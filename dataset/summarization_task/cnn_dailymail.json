Kevin Bollaert, 28, was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion for operating ugotposted.com, where anonymous users posted nude photos, often of women and often without their consent. Accompanying most of the photos were victims' names, residences and identifying information such as links to social media accounts, authorities stated. Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, faces up to 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . He also ran changemyreputation.com, where victims could pay fees of up to $350 to scrub their images and data from Bollaert's other site. California state law regarding identity theft prohibits the posting of personal information like names and addresses, 'for any unlawful purpose, including with the intent to annoy or harass. Authorities believe the conviction is the first against a revenge porn website operator, coming ahead of the trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com. Bollaert notably was not charged under the state's new law criminalizing revenge porn, which was signed after he reportedly shut down ugotposted.com. Prosecutors claimed that visitors to Bollaert's site posted more than 10,000 nude photos between 2012 and 2013. They also explained Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars after victims visited changemyreputation.com and paid between $300 and $350 to get photos removed. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators his life had been ruined by the site . Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Bollaert's lawyer, Emily Rose-Weber, had argued that while the website may have been immoral, he did not break the law by allowing others to use the site to post photos. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' she said. Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just like ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said.",

        "article": "A star Vanderbilt student has testified in her alleged rapists' trial that she only knew she had been assaulted when she watched video footage of the alleged attack. The woman, whose identity is being concealed, took to the stand in Nashville, Tennessee on Thursday in the rape trials of former football players Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey. The men and two of their teammates stand accused of sexually assaulting the unconscious woman in a dorm room after a night of drinking in June 2013. The court has already heard testimony from other witnesses that the woman had been assaulted with a water bottle, smacked, raped and urinated on while Vandenburg 'egged on' the men. Accused: Brandon Vandenburg, left, and Cory Batey, right, are on trial in Nashville, Tennessee for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman in a dorm room at Vanderbilt in June 2013 . On Thursday, the alleged victim recounted how she had drank more alcohol than usual while out with friends at a local bar, the Tin Roof, and while there, she bumped into Vandenburg, whom she was dating. The last thing she can remember is being in the bar at around midnight, she said. 'I remember waking up in an unfamiliar room at 8-something the next morning,' she said. After the alleged attack, she had walked to a friend's neighboring room and slept there for about three hours. She woke up feeling disorientated, sick and in pain, she said. She recalled how she felt pain on some parts of her body, such as her shoulder, wrist and knee, but she did not feel as if she had been sexually assaulted. 'I was sore all over but those hurt particularly badly,' she recalled. That afternoon, the woman said that Vandenburg invited her to his room before initiating sex . They had unprotected sex for a few seconds, which left her 'confused', she said. Injuries: Katherine Parnell, a nurse at Metro General who carried out a rape kit on the victim, said the young woman had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, and scratches on her feet . In the days after, she became 'somewhat' aware of rumors about the incident, she said, but when she texted with Vandenburg, he insisted that he was 'getting blamed for stuff that didn't even happen'. Initially the woman offered to help him, she said. Several days after the alleged assault, she went to Metro General to undergo a rape kit. The nurse who attended to her, Katherine Parnell, testified on Thursday that rape kits are usually carried out within 72 hours of the incident - putting the woman's outside that window. Parnell had noted that the student had multiple bruises across her thighs and buttocks, scratches on her ankles and a wound to her knee. By looking at how the injuries were healing, it appeared they had likely occurred around the time of the incident, Parnell testified. She added that when the woman came to the hospital, she could recall nothing of an alleged assault, including whether or not she had had sex or if condoms had been worn. Shocking: The victim's former roommate took the stand on Wednesday to describe what she looked like the morning after the attack, expressing her shock at how disheveled her friend had appeared . It was only later that the woman watched cell phone footage from the assault and identified herself as the victim, she said, The Tennessean reported. She only watched it once, she said. The jury previously heard how Vandenburg had sent footage and pictures of the alleged attack to friends in California before urging them to delete it the following morning. 'Did you consent to any of the acts done to you?' Prosecutor Tom Thurman asked the woman. 'Absolutely not,' she responded. On Wednesday, the woman's best friend described how her then-roommate's distressing appearance the morning after the attack is said to have occurred. Lauren Miller said she went to a bar with the victim the night leading up to the attack, and told the court her reaction the next time she saw her friend the following morning. She says her roommate came back to their condo with a gash on her leg, looking ill and 'out of it'. 'My immediate reaction was \"Woah, what happened to you?\"' Miller recalled. Co-accused: Former Vanderbilt players Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (left) and Brandon Banks (right) also face charges connected to the alleged rape. McKenzie testified that he did not touch the woman . 'So just from a physical standpoint, starting from top to bottom, her makeup was completely disheveled, the one thing I very clearly remember was the state of her hair. She had had it curled the night before and I remember being like, \"'Did you go jump in a pool?\"' She says she also found her roommate's black heel on the lawn outside their condo, and later overheard a voicemail message left by Vandenburg that her friend played on speaker. 'I heard him talking to (the woman) and saying he had just gotten out of football meeting, and he was being accused of some very horrible things that he did not do,' Miller recalled. 'And he was telling (the woman) to not believe anything she heard.' Vandenburg and former teammates Cory Batey, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks face five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography. Two other former Vanderbilt athletes took the stand as well on Wednesday to give their witness accounts of the event. Questions: Miles Finley, Vandenburg's friend from California, told jurors he was receiving graphic videos from his friend on the night of the attack but did not know that the alleged rape was happening at the time . 'Enablers': Former Vanderbilt athletes Michael Retta (left) and Dillon Van Der Wal (right) testified on Wednesday that they saw the victim passed out in front of Vandenburg's door but did not inform police . Then Vanderbilt tennis player Michael Retta and football player Dillon Van Der Wal told the jury that they saw the victim lying outside of Vandenburg's room that morning but neither reported the incident to police at the time. They both gave conflicting reports about whether Vandenburg asked for help moving the girl to his bed. Retta says he saw the alleged victim naked in the morning hours of June 23, while Van Der Wall said he saw the woman with 'handprints on her buttocks'. He also described Vandenburg's emotions that morning, saying he was 'extremely fidgety,' 'not acting normal,' and pacing. The prosecution rested on Thursday afternoon. The trial was expected to last 10 days but is now in its third week.",

        "article": "Message: Leading head teacher Nigel Lashbrook has said that students must learn to break the rules . Schoolchildren must become rebels to ensure Britain  produces independent thinkers, the head teacher of a leading private school has said. Nigel Lashbrook from the £30,000-a-year Oakham School in Rutland said that students must learn to break the rules like activists Rosa Parks and Emmeline Pankhurst. He also described the work of inventor James Dyson, Steve Jobs and Sir Richard Branson as examples of how people successfully challenged the rules of business. His school has run a 'rules and rebellion' week where students were encouraged to do the same. Oxford-educated Mr Lashbrook described how the Suffragette movement in Britain and the civil rights movement in the Unites States are proof of how people can change history by breaking rules. He said: 'There are well-cited examples of acts of social rebellion, including Rosa Parks breaking the rules of segregation to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, becoming an icon of resistance to racial segregation. 'Or Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, who rebelled against the legal and social norms of their day to fight for voting rights for women . 'Our schools rightly teach pupils about these momentous acts of rebellion. But do we do enough to teach those same students how they can, and should, stand up for what they believe?' His speech was part of a week of events at his school, which included a number of speakers. Philosopher Roger Scruton, fashion academic professor Amy de la Haye  and Jon Thompson, the Permanent Under Secretary responsible for the Ministry of Defence, spoke to students. Boarders also watched a selection of 'disruptive' films including The Breakfast Club and The Hunger Games. Prestigious: The £30,000-a-year Oakham School in Rutland has held a 'rules and rebellion' week . Inspiration: Mr Lashbrook told students Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and American civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks carried out great acts of rebellion and changed history as a result . Mr Lashbrook said: 'It is a fundamental part of any education to encourage pupils to have a strong moral compass, and to teach them to understand and abide by laws and regulations. 'But it is also our responsibility to give pupils the skills and the confidence to know when and how they should question the rules, the established conventions or social norms, and in some instances, the authority. 'We must all prepare students to be able to stand up for what they believe. If they cannot learn to do this now, in the safety of their school years, how will they fare later on in life?'",

        "article": "Disney’s timeless princesses and villains have captured the imagination of millions across the world. But what would they look like if their exaggerated features were translated into real-life anatomy? Israeli artist Karen Graw, who works under the name ‘Avalonis’, attempted to find out in this series of portraits. From top left to right, then next rows: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider, Mother Gothel, Tiana, Charlottle LaBouffe, Esmeralda, Frollo, Quasimodo, Giselle, Jane, Tarzan, . Cinderella, Belle, Prince Adam, Gaston, Jafar, Mulan, Alice, Jasmine, Aladdin, Aurora, Prince Philip, Maleficent, Cruella, Meg, Hercules, Pocahontas, Snow White, The Evil Queen, Ariel, Prince Eric, Ursula . Ms Graw said she manipulated each photo until she got ‘the right features and made them real enough looking.’ She admitted to having some difficulty with ‘ridiculously proportioned Disney characters’ such as Hercules and Cruella de Vil. The results, however, are surprisingly realistic and show just what a real-life Belle or Cinderella might look like if you bumped into them on the street. These portraits were designed by Israeli artist Karen Graw. Below each portrait is the original character created by Disney. From top left clockwise: Prince Philip from Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent also from Sleeping Beauty, Cruella Deville from 101 Dalmations, Meg from Hercules, Ursula, Prince Eric and Ariel from the Little Mermaid . From top left clockwise: Esmeralda, Frollo, Quasimodo (all from the Hunchback of Notre-Dame) Jafa from Aladdin and Gaston and Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast . From top left clockwise: Mulan, Alice from Alice in Wonderland, Jasmine from Aladdin, Pocahontas, Hercules and Meg from Hercules . From top left clockwise: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider from Rapunzel, Mother Gothe also from Rapunzel, Tarzan, Jane from Tarzan and Giselle from Enchanted . Despite these real-life representations, Disney's unrealistic proportions have repeatedly come under fire. Only . last month, Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland . found that Disney tends to animate its typically-thin female . protagonists even thinner when they are portrayed as the subject of . romantic attention. In . looking at seven studies that survey average wrist sizes, Mr Cohen . found ‘a range for women of 15.4 cm to 16.3 cm and for men of 17.5 cm to . 18.1 cm’. A . survey of U.S. Army members discovered that the average ratio of men’s . to women’s wrist sizes weigh in at just 1.15-to-1. That correlation is . not accurately depicted in Disney’s animations, he says. Avalonis isn’t the only one who has attempted to bring Disney’s magic to life. California-based . photographer  Ryan Astamendi has also created incredible real-life . versions of Disney princesses - and the likenesses are uncanny. Mr . Astamendi’s project, named 'the Princess Series', involved shooting . real-life versions of his favourite Disney princesses one-by-one.

        "article": "For some parents it can feel like their children are never going to leave home, but spare a thought for adult giant armadillos. New research, using automatic camera traps, has shown at these rare and elusive scaly-skinned mammals have to put up with some extremely clingy offspring. Scientists had thought that young giant armadillos struck out on their own to find their own territory at six weeks old, but research shows this is closer to 17 months. Scroll down for video . Remotely triggered camera trap pictures showed that Alex the young giant armadillo was still interacting, often in quite tender moments, with his mother more than a year after he should have become independent . The four year study of the termite-eating creatures revealed the youngsters continue sharing dens with their mothers long after they are capable of looking after themselves. The findings suggest that giant armadillos may be nature's equivalent of human parents who suffer from so-called 'full-nest syndrome', where their adult children stay at home well into their thirties. Dr Arnaud Desbiez, head of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Giant Armadillo Project, made the discovery while studying an adult female armadillo and her baby. Night time camera traps set up in the Pantanal tropical wetlands of Brazil captured the never seen before intimacy between the mother and her son, which scientists called Alex. Dr Desbiez said: 'We discovered that young giant armadillos continue to interact and share dens with their mothers for much longer than previously thought.' He added that although the youngster began exploring and foraging on its own after six months, it continued to share a burrow for at least year after that. Giant armadillos live in burrows in wetland habitats in South America and although normally solitary, mothers seem to allow their offspring to continue living with them for at least a year after they can care for themselves . Dr Desbiez first captured pictures of the wild baby armadillo with his mother in 2012 and was able to watch as he grew up. While spending short amounts of time away from home foraging, Alex continued to regularly interact with her and either share her burrow or stay in another close by. It is still unclear exactly what age young armadillos finally break their ties completely from their mothers as Alex is continuing to cling to his patient mother. Giant armadillos are 'ecosystem engineers' that help to protect other wildlife in the Brazilian wetlands from the searing tropical heat, according to previous work by Dr Arnaud Desbiez. Using camera traps in front 70 giant armadillo burrows to take pictures of animals that came to use the burrows. Published in the journal of Biotropica, the study found that the mounds attracted pumas, tapirs, a type of wild pig called Peccaries along with insects and amphibians. The burrows are thought to provide shelter for the animals from the heat during the day, and cold at night, by providing a stable temperature below ground. Dr Desbiez said: 'Think of them like wine cellars.' Armadillos are the largest members of the Xenarthra order of mammals that includes anteaters and sloths, part of a family that goes back at least 65 million years. Covered in a flexible armour that consists of up to 17  bands of horn and bone, they can grow nearly five feet in length, weigh up to 110lbs and live up to 15 years. They have large powerful claws for tearing into termite mounds. However, observing these creatures in the wild is extremely difficult as they are nocturnal and spend much of their time in their burrows. Giant armadillos are currently categorized as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List as habitat loss and hunting has reduced their numbers. Dr Desbiez, a French researcher who lives in Pantanal, started studying giant armadillos in 2010, using radio trackers and camera traps in an attempt to learn about their hidden lives. They found that gestation lasts five months instead of four and that they only give birth to one baby at a time, instead of two as had been believed. Dr Desbiez believes the animals only give birth once every two years, meaning they invest huge amounts in raising their young. His findings could also have a dramatic impact on attempts to conserve the mammals, as it means their population growth rates are extremely slow. With such a low birth rate, they can easily go extinct in local areas, he warned. Dr Desbiez was able to follow a mother giant armadillo and her baby, named Alex, from the moment of birth using specially designed night vision cameras that filmed their intimate parenting behaviour . Giant armadillos are rarely seen in the wild as they are nocturnal and tend not to live closely together so most research has been carried out on captive animals that have been kept in zoos . Dr Desbiez said: 'We have made lots exciting discoveries about their ecology and behaviour and interactions with other species and how their burrows are used by other species.' Now he hopes his camera trap images of the giant armadillos can help to raise awareness of the secretive creatures. The pictures he has captured have been awarded a runner up prize in the New Behaviour and Rare Species categories of the BBC Wildlife Magazine Camera-trap Photo of the Year 2014 competition. Dr Desbiez said: 'The worldwide recognition of these rare photographs helps share the wonder and passion we feel for the mysterious giant armadillo. 'Due to its low population density, nocturnal activity and secretive nature, the giant armadillo could become locally extinct without anyone noticing.'",

Detectives have asked prosecutors to consider charging a man with the murder of university graduate Melanie Hall nearly 20 years ago. The 45-year-old, who was arrested on suspicion of the 25-year-old's murder last year, remains on police bail. Avon and Somerset Police said a file of evidence had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service and the force was waiting for a charging decision. Miss Hall, who worked at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, vanished after a night out at Cadillacs nightclub in Walcot Street, Bath, in June 1996. In 2009 her remains were found by the side of the M5 by a workman who was clearing vegetation on the slip road at junction 14, near Thornbury, south Gloucestershire. Earlier this year, police appealed for information about the owner of the white VW Golf GTi hardtop, reg C752 CYE, during the summer of 1996. An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'Detectives investigating the murder of the Bath woman Melanie Hall in 1996 have now asked the Crown Prosecution Service for a decision on whether to charge a suspect. 'A 45-year-old man, who was arrested at his home in the city last November on suspicion of murder, has today been further bailed until the beginning of December while the CPS considers the evidence against him.' Nicola Haywood, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS South West, said: 'Avon and Somerset Police have handed a file to the CPS for consideration as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence on which to charge anyone in relation to the disappearance and death of Melanie Hall.' Miss Hall's father, Steve, spoke last year of his hope that his daughter's killer would be brought to justice. 'Gradually the pieces of the jigsaw are being put together to bring Melanie's killer or killers to justice,' he said. Melanie's father Steve, left and mother Pat Hall. Last year, Mr Hall spoke of his hope that his daughter's killer would be brought to justice . 'We always knew it would take a long time, but these new developments appear very encouraging.

        "article": "Most people pride themselves on trying to keep their homes - and themselves - clean and tidy. But new research undertaken by the Rug Doctor has suggested that we are perhaps not as house proud and sanitary as we would like people to think. Their new study of more than 2,000 people has shown that when it comes to making our beds over half of us will leave our dirty sheets on for weeks. The Rug Doctor has revealed that our houses are not as clean as we think they are with traces of horse and fox poo being found on the carpets of those surveyed . What's more, one third of people have said that they don't wash their hands after going to the toilet which directly increases the spread of germs around your property. The Rug Doctor also swabbed 30 carpets and shoes from a cross section of homes and found some pretty astonishing - not to mention disturbing - results. In fact you might want to put down your lunch before reading this. The carpets were found to contain traces of horse manure, fox poo, urine, vomit and tar as well as human and pet hair, pollen and traces of skin. The shoes that were swabbed were found to have high levels of bacteria as well as traces of animal and human gut and faecal bacteria. One third of us don't wash our towels every week, even though they can harbor harmful bacteria . The survey also found that one in ten don't wash their towels weekly and the same number do not brush their teeth twice a day. And only half of us - 53 per cent - shower or bathe once a day. Almost a third of pet owners admit they let their furry friends sleep in the bed with them, with more than 40 per cent saying they let them up on the sofa. Dr Pixie McKenna who presents the Embarrassing Bordies series revealed that she was shocked by the results of the Rug Doctor's survey . Dr Pixie McKenna from Embarrassing Bodies explained her horror at the results. She said, 'Rug Doctor's work to assess the nation's hygiene habits has thrown up some shocking stats, particularly how little care people take to remove bacteria and grime within their homes. 'Men are the worst offenders at not washing their hands after going to the toilet (38 per cent). 'But more worrying, is the fact that dangerous bugs like pneumonia and E Coli are being brought into our homes on the soles of our shoes. 'These are then trampled into the carpets by us not removing our shoes at the door. In fact, 41 per cent of people say they still don't intend to remove their footwear at the door, even though Rug Doctor has revealed the nasties lurking in their carpets. 'This is no laughing matter people of the UK poor hygiene at home risks your health!' Not only is it a case of dirt being brought into the house, but spills, stains and mishaps are adding to the ground-in grime in our carpets. More than a quarter - 28 per cent - of the UK's population has had a pet be sick on the flooring and 24 per cent have had a pet leave their mess. Furthermore nearly a third - 30 per cent - have had a baby or someone else be sick on their carpet and a quarter - 22 per cent - admit to having had sex on the floor. The Rug Doctor is a professional level carpet cleaning machine which wet cleans your floors getting deeper into the pile than a normal hoover clean would. They recommend that you wet clean your carpets at least twice a year in order to prevent the spread of germs.",

        "article": "Britain's first Muslim free school is controlled by religious hardliners who ban children from singing or reading fairy tales and force staff to wear headscarves - according to the former head teacher and deputy who claim they were forced to leave. Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned from his role as head of al Madinah School in Derby in August, two months after deputy Suzanne Southerland stepped down from her post. Both allege they were 'bullied and sidelined' by members of the school's trust, which is predominantly Muslim. The school strongly denies the pair's claims. Allegations: Staff claim religious hardliners have banned singing and fairy tales at the al-Madinah School, Derby . But earlier this week, concerns were raised by teachers who complained they were being ordered to wear the hijab – even if they are not Muslim. Now claims have been made that alongside the strict dress code, the school's 200 pupils are banned from playing stringed instruments, which are forbidden in the Islamic faith. Singing is also forbidden unless it involves Islamic faith songs, while youngsters are not allowed to read fairy tales as these are 'non-Islamic'. A staff member told The Sunday Times: 'When teaching children the alphabet, you could not associate the letter 'p' with pig.' They added: 'We were told that we couldn't read the children a story about a witch because it's seen as being non-Islamic.' Other staff have highlighted ‘concerns’ over the school's practices, which include banning non-halal food and forcing female pupils as young as four to sit at the back of the class away from boys. Claims: A Muslim member of staff from Al-Madinah School. Some other members of staff are claiming they have been asked to wear headscarves . Female members of staff, some of whom are not Muslims, say they have been told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab. These also ban them from wearing jewellery on the school’s premises in Derby. One woman, who had been interviewed for a position, claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers to avoid ‘insult’. Another staff member, speaking anonymously to the Mail, said the school was ‘like being in Pakistan’. She said: ‘Girls are treated very separately from boys, the girls sit at the back of the classroom. ‘Boys go and eat first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go. ‘It is like being in any school in Pakistan. That is why it was founded, that is the idea.’ The decision to make all female members of staff, regardless of religious beliefs, wear the Islamic headscarf – which covers the head but not the face – was apparently introduced over the summer. But some female members of staff have been spotted removing the headwear immediately after stepping out of the school building during their lunch hour. And around half a dozen teachers at the free school, who could face losing their jobs if they refuse to comply with the rules, are now seeking legal advice from the National Union of Teachers. Regional NUT officer Nick Raine said: ‘We are very worried about the school and the education of the 200 children there. ‘There are worries over practices . concerning the discrimination between male and female pupils in the . school, with the girls being told to sit at the back of the class . regardless of whether they can see the board properly.' He added: ‘It’s one thing to have a dress code which we can challenge and quite another to build it into a contract. ‘The school is publicly accountable so there needs to be a greater level of transparency.’ As a free school, Al-Madinah operates outside local authority control but still qualifies for government funding. It was set up in September last year. Sue Arguile, branch secretary of the . Derby National Union of Teachers, said the new demands stem from the . Al-Madinah’s free school status. A hijab is typically worn by a Muslim . female beyond the age of puberty in the presence of adult males - it . covers the head and chest, but not the face. It . not only refers to the physical body covering, but also a state of . mind, where al-hijab refers to ‘the veil which separates man or the . world from God’. Hijab can also be used to refer to the seclusion of women from men in public. Most . often, it is worn by Muslim women as a symbol of modesty, privacy and . morality. If differs from a burqa, a veil that covers the entire body . head and face, and the niqab which covers the entire head and face . except for the eyes. She said: ‘We have always had a number of concerns about this school ever since it was first set up, as essentially they can do what they like. ‘There is no buffer between them and the state and no protection for staff and pupils. ‘Free schools set their own rules, curriculums and dress codes, and so long as pupils and staff are aware of them before joining, then there is no upset. ‘But forcing people to agree to contractual changes or face being out of work could breach employment law.’ Former head teacher Andrew Cutts-McKay, who left after less than a year in the post, previously said the school would ‘honour all faiths’. However he admitted that he thought at least half of the school’s pupils would be Muslims. The school’s acting principal Stuart Wilson, who began his job on September 5, denied claims of bullying towards his former colleagues. He also disputed that there was anything within staff contracts requiring women to wear the hijab or a headscarf. However, he added: 'The expectation for female staff, raised in adverts and interviews, is that the head is covered while on site. To date, no complaint has been raised with the governing body relating to female staff wearing the hijab or headscarf.'

The plane came to within just 40ft of the remote-controlled model aircraft, which the report stated may have been flying at 600ft. A UK Airprox Board report labelled the incident on February 4 2014 as 'high severity' and said the 'safety of the aircraft may have been compromised'. Scroll down for video . A Tutor training plane similar to the one being flown above Northborough on February 4 last year . The trainer, from RAF Wyton near Huntingdon, had to take evasive action when the near-miss happened above the village of Northborough, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. The pilot of the Tutor aircraft was forced to bank hard to the left in order to avoid a collision after it appeared both aircraft were flying at the same height. The report stated: 'The differing perceptions of aircraft height from the Tutor pilot and model aircraft operator are fundamental to this incident. 'The model aircraft operator believed that his aircraft was flying considerably lower than seemed to be the case, backed up by the evidence of the Tutor’s height from radar replays.' While the report said the local model aircraft flying club had been permitted to use the airspace, the safety board report concluded 'safety margins had been much reduced'. The board suggested because nearby RAF Wittering had changed to a non-flying base, users of the airspace had become less aware of dangers. It said all operators in the area needed to be alert to each other's activities. The Ministry of Defence said RAF Wittering had since returned to flying status. Peterborough Area Radio Control Society member Dave Wood said he was familiar with the incident. 'We can only gauge that height that we're flying and we tend not to fly too high anyway. You're not likely to go up too high anyway - but we're bound to keep within 400ft with models that are (under) 7kgs. 'I wasn't the person involved. He reported the incident because he felt it necessary that the full sized aircraft are aware that we are there because we've been there for forty years.' The club's secretary Paul Holroyd declined to comment, saying that he disputed some of the facts in the report.",

The ABC reports that Melbourne man Khamis Gewargis Khamis joined an Assyrian militia called Dwekh Nawsha, which translates as 'self sacrificers'. After the Islamic State's assault on the Assyrian minority in Iraq the militia was formed in response. Across the north of the country IS has forced tens of thousands of Assyrians from their homes. Khamis Gewargis Khamis is fighting in northern Iraq for an Assyrian militia called Dwekh Nawsha . 'They don't discriminate when it comes to killing, torture and so on,\" Mr Khamis told the ABC from his base in northern Iraq. 'These are barbaric people, they came here only to die for what they believe in, so you can imagine the terror that they are spreading among the families, the kids and so on.' He is stationed with other Dwekh Nawsha fighters in a town called Baqofa, around 30 kilometres from the major IS-held city of Mosul. Mr Khamis is married and has two children. Just two kilometres down the road is a town called Batnay, which is on the front line. IS holds the town after driving out the Christian inhabitants. Kashmiri demonstrators hold up a flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) during a demonstration against Israeli military operations in Gaza . 'In the last few days (Islamic State) have been trying to come to these towns. They were somehow stopped by the coalition forces, from the air, and Peshmerga as well,' Mr Khamis said. 'We are on frontline, so last few nights there has been bombing from both sides, shelling. So yes, Dwekh Nawsha is frontline, trying to defend this town as much as we can. 'We have to have our own force, so we do need support as much as we can. We are appealing to the international community, particularly Australia, to help as well. Iraqi government forces celebrate while holding an Islamis Sate (IS) group flag after they claimed they gained complete control of the Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad . 'To be honest, Dwekh Nawsha is not receiving anything from the central government or the Kurdistan government or Kurdistan region, as we are independent militia, so as you can imagine, these Dwekh Nawsha need salaries, weapons, accommodation and so on.' However, Mr Khamis was ready to defend himself if there were any consequences concerning breaking Australian foreign fighters laws by taking up arms with the militia. Iraqi government hold an Islamis Sate (IS) group flag to celebrate gaining control of the Diyala province . 'I am concerned, we do love Australia, it's our second home, we love it as much as we love Iraq,' he explained. 'We are concerned, but if anything happens because of my travel here and supporting and joining Dwekh Nawsha I am happy and prepared to stand in front of the law. 'We would like the entire international community to be stronger, to get together and urgently help (the Assyrians) from the humanitarian side, and also to do what they can to eradicate (Islamic State), to eliminate them, to drive them out of these towns, villages and these territories so the people can return back to their homes and their lands.'",

The 18-year-old, born in Sheffield and based in Leeds, has been Leeds’s young sportswoman of the year for the past two years, but she put herself on the national map last night by storming home in a time of 1min 6.35sec ahead of Lorna Tonks of Australia and Jamaica’s Alia Atkinson. Atkinson looked in control of the race until the Briton next to her sensed a weakness on the home straight. Top trio: Gold medallist Sophie Taylor (centre) poses with runner-up Lorna Tonks (left) and bronze winner Alia Atkinson (right) Too strong: Taylor powers through the water on her way to winning gold for England . ‘I could see Alia next to me and could see that she was dying,’ Taylor said. ‘I just gave it my all.’ Earlier in this meeting, Taylor’s fellow English teens Ben Proud (in the 50m butterfly) and Adam Peaty (in the 100m breaststroke) took gold for England to inject some optimism into a British swimming revival at Olympic level. Peaty won another medal to add to this Games haul last night, taking silver in the 50m breaststroke behind Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa — the reigning Olympic 100m champion Peaty defeated a few days ago over that distance. Proud: Taylor takes in the atmosphere during an emotional medal ceremony . England’s Fran Halsall finished out of the medals in the 100m freestyle final, but compatriot Aimee Willmott won silver in the 200m fly and Adam Barrett won 100m fly bronze behind South African winner Chad le Clos. Taylor’s stated ambition is to compete at the Rio Olympics, where she would like to face one of her heroes, the Plymouth-based Lithuanian Olympic 100m champion Ruta Meilutyte, still only 17 herself. Among the things they have in common is a shared respect for Meilutyte’s coach Jon Rudd, who oversaw a pre-Commonwealth Games camp for the England team at the London Olympic pool.",

        "article": "Sportsmail's panel of experts Nasser Hussain, Paul Newman, Lawrence Booth and David Lloyd discuss the lessons to be learnt from this summer . What more must Alastair Cook do to challenge Michael Clarke as a captain? Nasser Hussain: Still quite a lot. Cook has to learn both from the 10 Tests England failed to win and the three they did. He has to keep focusing on his batting – he has made technical changes that have worked against India but will they work against Mitchell Johnson? David Lloyd: Not a lot. Michael Clarke had a fantastic attack in the last Ashes and when you’ve got that everything else becomes pretty easy. If Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad continue to bowl as well as they have done the captain can deal with any situation. A lot of this ‘funky’ captaincy business is for effect. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Root and Anderson thrilled with win . Taste of success: England celebrate impressive series win against India at The Oval . Lawrence Booth: . He’ll never match Clarke for funkiness but he can watch how Clarke . always tries to stay ahead of the game. England’s worst moments this . summer came when Cook let things drift. Paul Newman: . Nothing. He must do things his way. Cook’s strengths are leading by . example and creating a healthy environment that earns the respect of his . team. They are all behind him. Once he scored runs at Southampton . everything else fell into place and he grew as a captain. How did England turn it around against India? Newman: . The senior players in Cook, Bell, Anderson and Broad were all back to . their best from Southampton onwards which allowed the less experienced . ones to grow without the pressure of delivering in every match. India . helped by becoming obsessed with getting Anderson banned and losing . focus. Booth: . A bit of luck, some resolve, and the realisation that something had to . change. They were in denial until they got to Southampton. They were . also helped by India’s ineptitude. Inspired: England's Gary Ballance has gone from strength to strength since taking the No 3 slot . Lloyd: . Cook being back in the runs was the key. Once he scored them in the . third Test he became a better captain and England immediately looked . like a much better team. He hasn’t totally cracked it yet and he still . hasn’t got that hundred but he’s getting there. Hussain: Through . the senior players, mainly the fabulous bowling of Jimmy Anderson and . Stuart Broad and the mental strength and steely determination of . Alastair Cook. They found rock bottom and discovered that the only way . is up. Cook must take a lot of the credit for the way the series was . transformed. Who have been the star performers among the Test new boys? Booth: . Gary Ballance has allowed us to quietly forget Jonathan Trott and, . unlike Trott, he has a fifth gear. Jos Buttler is incredibly exciting. It was a huge moment when England accepted that Matt Prior’s time was . up. Lloyd: Gary . Ballance first and foremost and Moeen Ali has gone from strength to . strength with the ball but they have all done well. The only remaining . question is what must they do with Sam Robson? I’ve said it before but . Robson must lighten up. He can’t be staring at the pitch after every . ball. Key man: Joe Root played a pivotal role in England's series triumph . VIDEO Root and Anderson thrilled with win . Newman: . Peter Moores decision to give Gary Ballance the No 3 slot proved . inspired and I am delighted that Moeen Ali has shown that he really can . replace Graeme Swann as England’s spinner. They have all been successes . with the possible exception of Sam Robson and all have the potential to . grow more. Hussain: . It has to be Gary Ballance. To come in and fill the massive hole left . by Jonathan Trott while being able to ease the pressure on Alastair Cook . by increasing the tempo of his batting has been phenomenal. He can play . in different ways and notably goes up through the gears. How do we become less reliant on Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad? Lloyd: . Get Steven Finn fit and firing. If he can get back to bowling anything . like he was at his best then that will ease the pressure on Anderson and . Broad. What England are doing is getting a good battery of fast bowlers . together in time for 17 Tests in nine months from next April. Finn and . Stokes should be equally as effective as Jordan and Woakes. Hussain: . Provide emerging bowlers with proper chances, like batsmen get. Chris . Jordan has improved the more he has bowled. The key is to look after . Anderson and Broad so that they can go on as long as possible. I don’t . think either of them should play any more limited-overs cricket after . the World Cup. Pair of aces: James Anderson and Stuart Broad are a formidable new-ball partnership . Booth: . England already are. Chris Woakes was unlucky all series and Chris . Jordan got better after a shaky start. Waiting in the seam bowling wings . are Steven Finn, Ben Stokes and Liam Plunkett. Things look healthy. Newman: . It’s all about this ‘over-supply’ of players that Paul Downton talks . about. England have to create as big a pool as possible to cope with the . ridiculous demands that the schedule for 2015 and 2016 represents. Anderson and Broad will have to miss one-day cricket to be available for . all the Tests. Is Moeen Ali the answer as a spinner? Newman: . One hundred per cent yes. Derek Pringle put it perfectly when he said . ‘Moeen may not be a Swann but he’s no ugly duckling either.’ I always . thought he was better than Alastair Cook and Peter Moores seemed to . think and he has proved it. He has the potential to be better than . Nathan Lyon next summer. Booth: . He’s not in Graeme Swann’s class but these comparisons are unhelpful. What mattered is that he improved quickly. It’s hard to say if he’s . frontline yet – India were too poor for us to tell – but he’s way better . than part time. Positive spin: Moeen Ali is emerging as a frontline slow bowling option for England . Hussain: . In the short term, yes. He has been the answer to balancing the side . and there is no point in replacing him with a ‘specialist’ who can bowl . just a little bit better, if there is anyone like that out there. England still need to find a left-arm spinner to compliment Moeen while . the structure needs to be looked at so we produce more spinners. Lloyd: . Yes I think he is. You don’t take 19 wickets against India by accident! He must have something. He has grown in confidence and got more shape . in his action. Moeen can be for this side what Ashley Giles was for the . 2005 side. A key component of the team with ball and bat. What are our chances of regaining the Ashes and what do we need to improve? Hussain: . England’s chances are good. Home advantage is the key in modern Test . cricket. Only Zimbabwe lost any Tests at home throughout the whole of . 2013. How we play Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris will be the key. Australia are an ageing side while England have potential to grow, both . in and out of the side. Lloyd: . England have every chance of regaining the Ashes. The likes of Mitchell . Johnson, Ryan Harris, Chris Rogers and Brad Haddin are no spring . chickens. Will they all be here? Will Johnson be as good again as he was . last time? One thing England can improve is the pitches. They wanted . slow low ones last year against Australia but I think they will go the . other way next year. Follow the leader: Cook’s strengths are leading by example and creating healthy environment . Booth: . It depends if Mitchell Johnson is fit and firing. If he’s not England . will win. They need a reliable opening partner for Alastair Cook and Ian . Bell must rediscover the form that helped beat Australia 3-0 a year . ago. Newman: . I’m confident England will win the Ashes next year as long as Jimmy . Anderson and Stuart Broad have not been finished off by all the cricket . before then. We must keep our fingers crossed the operation on Broad’s . knee goes well while I think England need to find a new opener. Not sure . about Sam Robson. Name two players who could force their way into the side for the Ashes . Booth: . Nottinghamshire’s opener Alex Hales could be England’s answer to slam . bang Aussie opener David Warner. And I hope Steven Finn spends five . Tests against West Indies and New Zealand before then remembering what . it’s like to take Test wickets. Lloyd: . Alex Hales could do it and here’s a bit of a long shot for you, Simon . Kerrigan. I’ve got everything crossed when I say that but a lot of . people I respect have told me Kerrigan can bowl. I haven’t seen it . myself yet but I’m taking their word for it. One to watch: Alex Hales could force his way into Test team if he impresses in one-day format . Hussain: . If Alex Hales has a good six months of ODI cricket then he could be a . candidate but it would be a gamble. Other than opening it’s hard to see . where England need new players for next year which is a good sign but . I’d say Steven Finn if he concentrates on sheer pace. But both would . have to improve to get into next year’s side. Newman: I . can see where everybody is coming from when they say Alex Hales and it . may just work but we might have to accept a few failures from him in . exchange for the odd occasion when he would spectacularly come off. A . second player? Keep an eye on Alex Lees of Yorkshire. England rate him . very highly.",

The frightening footage, which looks to be have been taken from a balcony overlooking Port Phillip Bay, shows the divers uncontrollably falling out of the sky as thunder clashes and lightning bolts strike. Scroll down for videos . The first of 14 skydrivers who fell out of the sky at St Kilda beach after an unexpected storm hit . The diver plummeted at an almighty speed while a man captures the footage from a balcony in the distance . Within seconds the diver crashed into the water with huge force . After a 38-degree sunny day, a fierce storm quickly took hold with the skydivers suddenly facing an intense hail storm and violent winds. The extreme strength of the wind can be heard on the video with the cameraman struggling to hold the camera still while filming as one by one each diver dropped out of the dark sky and hit the rough waters at an almighty force. Horrified members of the public looked to the sky as the divers plummeted at a rapid pace before being battered across an expansive area of the beach and pier. Senior Paramedic Team Manager, Jo Wilton, said that it was a chaotic scene when they arrived. Lightning struck as the divers dramaticaly fell one by one into the water before two victims rushed to hospital and 12 others treated by paramedics . Many onlookers ran into the sea to rescue one of the victims who slammed into the water, pictured here bringing the man and his equipment to land . Gail force winds forced the skydivers to tumble through the air, crashing into the ground or water . During the free fall many were blown across the sky like rag dolls, lucky to escape with only minor injuries. The first two survivors were found on the pier just after 3pm and were treated by Metropolitan Fire Brigade marine firefighters. ‘They were all incredibly lucky. Witnesses say they hit the water or the ground really hard so it could have been a lot worse than what it was,’ Senior Paramedic Team Manager Jo Wilton said.

        "article": "A small Italian restaurant has tried a different approach to its lousy reviews on Yelp - instead of trying to boost its star rating, the chefs decided to encourage even more terrible write-ups. The campaign helped Botte Bistro get a rating of one out of five stars, as more than 1,000 reviewers left hundreds of tongue-in-cheek reviews panning the  eatery in Richmond, California, said chef Michele Massimo, adding that it boosted business. It was the latest protest among businesses who for years have complained that Yelp was extorting them by raising or dropping ratings depending on whether they advertised with the Web's most popular review site. Chef Michele Massimo prepares a salad at his restaurant Botto Bistro in Richmond, California earlier this month. The chef said appealing for one-star tongue-in-cheek reviews on Yelp has boosted his business . Yelp has persistently denied those claims on its website, in court and at every opportunity when the question is put publicly to the company. It recently got a federal appeals court to throw out a lawsuit alleging the extortion. 'It wouldn't pass the straight face test,' Yelp spokesman Vince Sullitto said of the extortion claims. Sullitto said Yelp attracts millions of viewers and sells advertising to 80,000 businesses because of the site's credibility with consumers. Sullitto said many of the company's critics are businesses that have received bad reviews. Last month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lawsuit filed by several businesses claiming Yelp extorted them by removing positive reviews after advertising sales pitches were turned down. The court is one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court and the ruling could have been a definitive one for Yelp. Badge of honor: Many restaurants are taking a stand against Yelp which has been accused of raising or dropping ratings depending on advertising spends . Instead, it served to fuel the company's critics because the court said that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to penalize businesses, the practice would not constitute extortion. The court said it found no evidence of manipulation and that it was ruling narrowly only on the question of extortion. Nonetheless, the company's critics said the ruling supported their claims of sharp practices. Even before the 9th Circuit ruling, Yelp was battling two lawsuits filed by company investors who make similar extortion claims. The suits, filed in San Francisco federal court over the summer, allege that the company's stock traded at artificially inflated prices because the 'company tried to sell services designed to suppress negative reviews or make them go away' and then lied it. The company has yet to formally respond to the lawsuits in court, but says it will fight these legal actions as well. Last year, a lawyer serving as a small-claims judge in San Diego likened Yelp to a 'modern-day version of the Mafia going to stores and saying, ''You want to not be bothered? You want to not have incidents in your store? Pay us protection money.''' The judge, Peter Doft, made the comments when he ordered Yelp to pay San Diego lawyer Julian McMillan $2,700 over a contract dispute involving advertising on Yelp. The award was later overturned by a higher court, which ruled that McMillan's dispute with Yelp should be decided by an arbitrator instead of a court. McMillan didn't pursue his claim. The Bruschetta di pomodoro (pictured left) and seafood pasta, Botto Cioppino (right) at the Richmond eatery. The chefs appealed to diners to give their food tongue-in-cheek one-star reviews . Botte Bistro in Richmond, California, (pictured) is a traditional Tuscan trattoria and pizzeria own by  Italian chefs Davide Cerretini and Michele Massimo . But Yelp did file a lawsuit against McMillan, alleging he and his employees submitted fake Yelp reviews of his law practice. McMillan denies the charges and alleges that Yelp sued him because of his small-claims court victory. The allegations are so widespread and have persisted for so long that the company asks on its Web site: 'Does Yelp extort small businesses?' The company answers no. Yelp has had a complicated relationship with merchants, restaurateurs and other small businesses on which the company depends on for advertising revenue. To attract advertising, Yelp needs to maintain a popular and credible site. To do this, Yelp says, its uses an algorithm to weed out fake reviews submitted by business owners, relatives and friends that is often misunderstood. The automated removal programs accidentally erase many positive reviews written by legitimate customers. Yelp concedes that removing legitimate reviews is not ideal, but argues that's the price it pays for its credibility. Furthermore, Yelp keeps details of its algorithm under wraps so its review system can't be easily exploited and gamed. That secrecy also breeds suspicion. 'We don't know who is leaving the reviews and we don't think it's fair,' said Massimo, the chef. 'You are so vulnerable.' Massimo said he and his partner decided to launch their novel protest for a one-star rating after receiving several aggressive sales calls from Yelp that they perceived to be veiled threats. The ploy worked and business continue to be brisk, he said. 'It was the best marketing idea I've ever had,' Massimo said. 'Thanks Yelp.'",

She said: ‘I admit it sounds bizarre that a boob job can have a positive impact on business but it’s true. ‘Before my operation my confidence held me back. I couldn't visualise myself talking confidently in seminars or at events and parties but now all that has changed. ‘When I tell people I had a boob job to boost my career they wrongly assume I wanted to be a glamour model but nothing could be further from the truth. ‘I think my story shows it’s not only glamour girls who have surgery to boost their careers, business women do too. ‘It’s all about having the confidence and the surgery has given me that.’ Miss Morgan from Long Sutton in Lincolnshire says she had always struggled with her self esteem after battling weight issues in her teens.

Confidence boost: She had the £4,000 operation in February 2013 and says her confidence increased dramatically . But matters came to a head when she was out celebrating her 18th birthday and became the target of abuse because of her weight. She said: 'A group of girls falsely accused me of being disrespectful to one of them and before I knew it they had rounded on me, calling me a fat cow and ridiculing me because of my size. ‘It turned into the worst birthday ever.’ So the determined teenager vowed to lose the weight and cut out all junk food and take-away meals from her diet. She also reduced her carbohydrate intake and instead ate a healthy diet of lean met and vegetables or salad. Ms Morgan also started exercising.

Thousands of supporters lined the streets of north London to hail Arsene Wenger's heroes 24 hours later during a triumphant open-top bus parade. There was a feeling of adulation on Upper Street that Sunday as fans celebrated the end of their much-hyped trophy drought, but there was another strong vibe in the air that day. Aaron Ramsey is mobbed by his Arsenal team-mates after scoring the winner against Hull in the FA Cup final . The streets of north London are lined by Arsenal fans as they celebrate their club's FA Cup triumph in 2014 . A sense that this was merely the beginning; the start of a period of dominance from another Wenger-led Arsenal team. But five months later, Gooners are again being asked to be patient. Everything is in place for a prosperous future at the Emirates Stadium. The club's self-sustainable financial structure is starting to have a significant impact in the new world of Financial Fair Play. But speaking ahead of Thursday's Annual General Meeting, chief executive Ivan Gazidis remained cautious. Speaking ahead of Arsenal's Annual General Meeting, Ivan Gazidis said the club are aiming to be held in the same esteem as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich and the rest of Europe's elite . 'Where we are currently is off the shoulder of the world's top teams. I think the best teams in the world are in Europe and you think about the great names in world football like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - I don't think we're at that level yet but that's where we're aiming to get to,' said the Gunners supremo. 'It's one thing to say that and it's another thing to be able to deliver it. It has been incredibly frustrating not being able to be where we want to be these last few years, so winning the FA Cup was a fantastic moment. '(But) I don't come out of that feeling satisfied like we've achieved what we need to achieve. The hunger for success is immediate. The moment you get away from that euphoria of the moment, the next question is, \"How do we have more of that?\" Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez arrived at Arsenal in the summer for a combined fee of £46million . 'That's what everybody at this club is focused on. There's no satisfaction in it - it's what do we do now.' When Gazidis' most recent comments were issued earlier this week, it must have felt like Groundhog Day for some fans; it's a message Arsenal supporters have become accustomed to in recent years. The message that the club are working hard to enter Europe's elite, but still not quite there. Recent big-money signings such as Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck have helped placate some disgruntled fans. But others remain doubtful that their club can replicate Wenger's glory years. Here, Sportsmail takes you on a trip down memory lane, looking at some of Gazidis' previous soundbites - and how they all have a similar theme: patience. Mesut Ozil joined the Gunners for a club record fee in the summer of 2013, but has failed to hit his top form . On the day Arsenal were due to meet Birmingham in the League Cup final - which they lost - Gazidis spoke of the sacrifices the club were making to ensure Arsenal's future success. FEBRUARY 2011: 'Some of the decisions we need to make looking forward will impact the manager adversely in the short term, but 10, 15 even 20 years from now, the decisions will make sure this club moves forward. 'Winning is important, but it's not the end objective of everything, the end objective is the emotional connection our fans have with this club. The end objective is the creation of pride, one of the aspects that creates pride is winning trophies and that's essential for a club our size, but the way we conduct ourselves, the way we play, all these things are important. 'It's right and proper that we are expected to win trophies regularly, and I welcome that pressure, that kind of pressure is good.' Arsenal were beaten by Birmingham in the 2011 League Cup final after Obafemi Martins scored the winner . In the aftermath of Arsenal's infamous 8-2 loss at Manchester United, Gazidis insisted the club would emerge stronger after a difficult few months which saw Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy quit the club. The belief that better days were ahead was a key theme. SEPTEMBER 2011: 'We are going through a difficult period like all clubs do, it's a cycle and we will work our way out of it. We understand some of the emotions the fans have been through, we understand the expectations are high and we share those expectations, that's where we are in the game - other clubs would be delighted to be in our overall position. 'We are in a healthy and strong position, we've had 14 years of success in the Champions League. When I came in two-and-a-half years ago I was told we were falling behind Aston Villa and Everton. The reality is we are in a strong position to look forward with confidence and standing on our own two feet, with a strong sustainable model built around youth development; we've got strong youth players coming through - not just Jack Wilshere. Arsene Wenger can't bring himself to watch the game as Arsenal are humiliated by Manchester United . The Old Trafford outfit ran out 8-2 winners against Arsenal. It was one of the club's worst-ever defeats . 'Our transfer strategy remains developing young players and turning them into star players, but we have sprinkled that with experienced players. It'll take a bit of time for those players to settle but we'll have a strong squad. You can't replace a Fabregas, one of the best players in the world and there's not an unlimited number of those. 'We are focused to continue to move forward as a club. If we spent every single penny we had in every transfer window, we would end up making some bad decisions.' Ahead of the 2012 season, Gazidis again spoke about the club's ability to compete with Europe's elite clubs… in the future, of course. JUNE 2012: 'We want to win major competitions. We want to win the Premier League. We want to compete to win the Champions League. That is our ambition. 'My message to our fans is that we are doing everything in our power to make sure that Arsenal can challenge for trophies next year. That is what this summer is about and that is what we are focused on for next year. 'We have a good team, we have a good young core of players and we need everybody involved to have belief so that we can push forward into next year and make a run at the Premier League trophy and for the Champions League. We believe we can do that.' Gazidis has spoken about Arsenal's ability to compete with some of Europe's best clubs, albeit in the future . And there was more of the same from Gazidis five months later. NOVEMBER 2012: 'As we look to the next two, three years we will have an outstanding platform on which to compete with any club in the world. Now we are in that stadium, the first part of our vision has been realised. Now we are at the stage where some of the commercial deals that were tied into the construction of the stadium, and enabled us to take that first big step, will be renegotiated. When that happens, we will take the second big step forward and that will be comparable in magnitude to moving to the stadium itself. 'At times it's been a challenging project, but we will have catapulted ourselves into the elite clubs on the European scale and that, for us, has been what the last 10 years has been about. 'Very clearly, it will push the club forward and put us into the top five clubs in the world in revenue terms, which will be a fantastic position to be in.' The Arsenal board addresses its audience at the 2011 Annual General Meeting at the Emirates Stadium . Still without a trophy, Gazidis returned with a familiar message at the end of the 2012/13 season. JUNE 2013: 'So obviously we have come to the end of the season and in the end we finished with 73 points and in fourth place which I would say was necessary for us. We want to be competing at the top of the game and in order to do that you have to be in the Champions League. So we are pleased to have qualified, or at least, for the qualification games. 'But it is not ultimately where we want to be with moving the club forward. We want to be a club that is competing at the very top end of the game and that means competing to win the Premier League and competing to win the Champions League. On that basis, we are not where we want to be yet. 'I think its not idle ambition when we talk about wanting to get there. I think we have a very solid plan that will give us the ability to be able to compete at that level provided we do things well. The critical thing now as we look ahead over the next season and the season after is our developing financial capability which will give us a lot more options than in recent years.' We wait with baited breath to see what Gazidis plans to say at Thursday's AGM. More of the same, perhaps? Jack Wilshere reflects on Arsenal's defeat at Chelsea - they are already nine points behind their rivals .",

        "article": "A California gym became a robotic warzone yesterday as drones battled it out in an annual engineering contest. The competition involved six teams of engineering students who were each given $800 (£480) to create machines that could fly or drive their way to victory.

According to the rules, the robots could be defensive but could not be designed to destroy the opposing teams’ machines. The winners were a team dubbed ‘40 Piece Chicken McNuggets’ who created two identical rovers that drove instead of flew. In the final round, it came down to the McNuggets and a team called the Cunning Stunts, which used their budget to make three roving robots as well as one flying design. ‘This is where rubber meets the road,’ said Carl Ruoff, instructor of ME72: Engineering Design Laboratory told Pasadena Star-News.

        "article": "England’s hopes of a revival following Wednesday’s win in Hambantota lasted as long as it took Kumar Sangakkara to reassert his superiority here in Colombo. For Sri Lanka, Sangakkara’s effortless 86 meant a six-wicket win and a nigh-on uncatchable 3-1 lead. For England’s stand-in captain Eoin Morgan, whose side blew their chance with the bat after a highly promising 90 in 109 balls from James Taylor, it was a reminder of how thankless leadership can be. And news that England had been fined for a slow over-rate — only four days after Alastair Cook had been suspended for the same offence — confirmed it. Batting at No 3 as the order was rejigged in Cook’s absence, Taylor produced an innings full of chutzpah, while Morgan himself crashed 62 off 47 balls as others flailed around him. England must now win the last three games to avoid another one-day series defeat. Even the most optimistic might struggle with that one. The truth was that, from 170 for three in the 35th over, a total of 265 was at least 20 below what they should have achieved. Taylor, needing treatment for cramp — a consequence of Colombo’s cloying heat and the energy-sapping exuberance of his batting — finally went when he could only sky Ajantha Mendis into the covers. In the next over, Ravi Bopara — having pleaded for a chance in the middle order — was bowled tamely by Tillekeratne Dilshan. That heralded some dim batting from the rest, and it was left to Morgan, with 18 off the last over, to ensure respectability. Kumar Sangakkara's innings of 85 guided Sri Lanka to victory over England in the fourth ODI in Colombo . James Taylor anchored England's innings as he scored 90 from 109 deliveries . Alex Hales was sent back to the pavilion with a golden duck to his name by Dhammika Prasad . Moeen Ali hit three boundaries before being stumped by Sangakkara for 19 . ‘We were aiming for 280-290 and the latter part of the innings wasn’t good enough,’ he said. ‘But James was outstanding. To come in after a long break and play as he did was brilliant.’ Morgan’s late flurry, which lifts his record as captain to 427 runs at an average of 71, briefly camouflaged another problem. On a Premadasa pitch offering turn, Sri Lanka’s four slow bowlers had taken nine wickets. England, on the other hand, again omitted off-spinner James Tredwell, preferring to take another look at the out-of-sorts Ben Stokes. Morgan said: ‘We did need another spinner but we wanted to give other guys a chance. Giving Ben a game here gives the selectors another chance to see what he’s about.’ In the event, Stokes sent down only two overs, taking his series figures to 8-0-85-0. Earlier, he had scored six before top-edging a sweep. If a cricketer can unpick himself for a World Cup, Stokes is doing precisely that. Joe Root was bowled by Rangana Herath for 36 to leave England on 122 for three in the 26th over . Taylor celebrates his 50, but he had to depart for 90 after being catch by Kusal Perera . Ravi Bopara departed soon after Taylor as he was bowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan . Dilshan celebrates the wicket of Bopara to leave England at 173 for five in the 36th over . Stand-in captain Eoin Morgan made a valuable contribution of 62 down the order . Morgan and Jos Buttler got into a tangle when they collided in the middle of the wicket while running . Chris Woakes had removed Dilshan early, but the folly of omitting Tredwell in a game which England had to win was underlined by a sharp-turning off-break from Moeen Ali which had Kusal Perera edging to slip. Instead, Mahela Jayawardene, back after missing the third game to mark his daughter’s birthday, helped his old mate Sangakkara put on 96 before Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews finished the job with two balls to spare. The 12 wides England bowled took their tally for the series to 43. Sri Lanka have sent down only 22. In the endless search for positives, Taylor provided a gimme. Playing only his third one-day international — and his first not against Ireland — he was nervous initially, before settling down with a six over midwicket off Thisara Perera. Ajantha Mendis also disappeared over the ropes and Taylor began to resemble the buccaneer who slashed three hundreds for Nottinghamshire in last summer’s Royal London One-Day Cup. Captain Morgan hit two sixes and a four in the last over to nudge England up to a total of 265 . Chris Woakes picked up England's first wicket as he dismissed opener Dlishan for 16 . Kusal Perera was the second wicket to fall for Sri Lanka as he was dismissed by  Ali for 31 . Mahela Jayawardene (left) and Sangakkara put on a 96-run partnership as Sri Lanka took command . Now England’s management face a dilemma when selecting the team for Wednesday’s fifth game in Kandy, when Cook, confirmed as captain for the World Cup, returns as opener. That leaves Alex Hales vulnerable only two matches after his return. His golden duck here was horribly anti-climactic, and he later dropped Mathews off Chris Jordan as Sri Lanka’s chase neared its conclusion. The other option would be to rest Joe Root, whose last two innings have brought him 48 not out and 36. Chris Jordan bowled Jayawardene for 44 to end his long partnership with Sangakkara . Sangakkara looked to be in complete control before picking out Woakes on the boundary for 86 . Jordan's double scalp of Jayawardene and Sangakkara proved to be too little, too late for England . Either way, Cook remains the cog around which others must fit. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek programme, England’s former batting coach Graham Gooch summed up the situation. ‘The best thing is to somehow get Cook back in form to make him worthwhile of his place in the team,’ he said. ‘He can only open and if he scores runs then all this talk will go away. I can’t see him not playing and still being in the squad.’ For the time being, though, England will be nursing their disappointment that another one-day series is on the verge of passing them by.",

        "article": "Kurdish fighters have killed dozens of Islamic State militants in recent days as battles continue to rage around the strategic Syrian border town of Kobane. In one village, a Kurd was today pictured standing over the bodies of Islamic extremists after they were killed in Halimce, a village east of the town. Around 20 jihadists also died in the hills west of Kobane days after it was recaptured following months of heavy fighting which has left the town in ruins. Kurdish forces retook the town on January 26 in a symbolic blow to the jihadists who have seized large swathes of territory in their onslaught across Syria and Iraq. Scroll down for video . A Kurdish fighter points at ISIS militants laying dead on the ground in the village of Halimce, near the Syrian town of Kobane after they were apparently lined up and shot . The bodies of around 20 Islamic extremists were rounded up days after the Kurds recaptured the strategic town of Kobane following months of heavy fighting which has left the town in ruins . Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman said: 'Nineteen ISIS members were killed in fighting against the (Kurdish) People's Protection Units (YPG) in the hills surrounding Manaz to the west of Kobane. 'Another three jihadists died in fighting around villages to the east of Kobane, while the YPG also took one ISIS member prisoner,' he told AFP. The YPG had also recaptured five villages around Kobane this week, according to Mr Rahman, whose Britain-based group relies on a network of sources inside Syria. But the Islamic State group still controls hundreds of villages in the area. 'Another 350 villages remain under ISIS control,' he said, referring to settlements in the area around Kobane. One civilian was also killed. 'ISIS shelling in the western countryside of Kobane killed a civilian,' said Mr Rahman, who has repeatedly stressed that the fight for the Kobane area is far from over. Hazard: It is not known whether this bomb in Kobane has already exploded or could detonate any minute . Bomb disposal: A local Kurdish militia group, the People's Protection Units have been scouring the city and dismantling unexploded bombs . Death from above: This rocket could have been fired from American-led coalition forces whose airstrikes targeted IS fighters in the city .

But given the mass of people currently adrift in southern Turkey and northern Syria, the camp will only be able to house a portion of Kobane inhabitants. And although ISIS fighters have apparently been defeated in the border city by Kurdish forces, authorities have warned residents against returning until the area has been fully secured.

        "article": "There are two options open to Chris Avalos when he enters the cauldron of Belfast’s Odyssey Arena this Saturday night to challenge Carl Frampton for the super-bantamweight championship of the world. ‘Fight or flight,’ says Frampton. ‘It’s up to him. ‘I hope it’s fight because that will be more entertaining for the fans and better for me. ‘But this is the hottest atmosphere for any sporting event in Ireland these days and there’s no telling which way my opponents will react when it hits them.’ Carl Frampton attends a press conference ahead of his world title defence against Chris Avalos . The IBF world super bantamweight champion exchanges words with the Mexican-American challenger . The fight will be broadcast on ITV in big-time boxing's first return for nearly a decade . Frampton sits with his young daughter, Carla, and mother, Flo (left), ahead of the press conference . Frampton knocks down Martinez during their IBF super-bantamweight world title bout in September . Frampton is optimistic that Avalos, an archetypal Mexican-American warrior by reputation, is coming to play his part in a spectacle which will carry the fanaticism for The Jackal across to mainland Britain as well as expand the audience for boxing in this country. The excitement surrounding Frampton has encouraged ITV to bring prize-fighting back to mainstream terrestrial television here for the first time in almost a decade. It gives Frampton’s promoter and mentor – Belfast’s legendary former world champion Barry McGuigan – the chance to generate wider public interest in his protege not just in Britain but around the world. This fight is being broadcast live in 55 other countries, including the United States where expectation is mounting for a title unification match between Frampton and Cuba’s ex-amateur genius Guillermo Rigondeaux. Before travelling to America, Frampton is more than willing to hop over to Manchester this summer to put his IBF belt on the line in a battle of Britain with Bury’s ‘regular’ WBA champion Scott Quigg. Both those fights have the potential to elevate Frampton from Belfast folk hero to global stardom but he knows that depends, firstly, on a stellar performance against Avalos. Avalos is expected to provide a stiff challenge for the reigning champion in Belfast on Saturday . The Northern Irishman is managed by former boxing great Barry McGuigan (left) The challenger engages in some word sparring with Frampton ahead of the main event on Saturday . Avalos defeats Khabir Suleymanov in round 10 of their super bantamweight clash in 2011 . ‘I’m under no illusions about this,’ he says. ‘I’m on the brink of something big now. I can’t afford any slip-ups at this stage and I need to continue to impress. There’s too much at stake.’ In that realisation Frampton has worked harder than ever under his trainer, McGuigan’s son Shane, in the intense confines of their gym in London’s increasingly fashionable Battersea. At just turned 28 – last Saturday - and with13 KO’s in his perfect 19-win record – he stands ready to deliver again. ‘I’m pretty confident of knocking Avalos out,’ he says thoughtfully, without bombast. ‘He’s a very good fighter and I expect him to be tougher than Quigg when we get round to that one. Certainly more aggressive. But because he usually comes on the offensive and leaves himself open to be hit I do think I will stop him.’ Frampton has put in more than 200 rounds of sparring against high-quality fighters, some of them markedly bigger than himself. With none of them proving able to go 12 rounds with him, that chore has been shared among them when he insists boxing the full championship distance. It is not only to ensure victory over Avalos, his mandatory challenger, that Frampton is living the Spartan life demanded of all who would be great champions. Frampton poses for pictures ahead of a public workout in Victoria Square, Belfast . Avalos takes part in the public workout in the Belfast shopping mall . ‘My ambition is not celebrity but to become acknowledged as the best super-bantamweight,’ he says. ‘And at some point soon that will mean beating not only Quigg but Rigondeaux, who everyone considers the greatest and I understand why at the moment. ‘Then, if I can do that, I will move up in weight in the hope that being a two-division world champion might be enough for me to be elected to the Hall of Fame.’ Frampton would like to add a win over WBC super-bantamweight belt holder, Leo Santa Cruz, to that resume but that US-based Mexican no longer appears as willing to face him as Avalos. Since joining the growing stable of top fighters in advisor Al Haymon’s stable, Santa Cruz has not only veered away from a big fight with Rigondeaux but also seems to be losing enthusiasm for taking on Frampton in either a Belfast stadium or in America. That increases the demands on Frampton to impress this weekend and then, probably, against Quigg in early summer. But he says: ‘I’m used to the pressure because I know I carry so many hopes for Belfast and Ulster with me into the ring.’ Frampton works out as he sets his sights on a unification fight with Guillermo Rigondeaux .

Frampton’s title-winning triumph over Kiko Martinez drew a 20,000 crowd to an open-air pop-arena in the historic dockyards where the Titanic was constructed – drawn from both sides of the sectarian divide, with men, women and children united in their vociferous support for this young Protestant who is happily married to a Catholic. But it is within the confines of the Odyssey that they raise the roof. Expect the crescendo to come with Frampton landing his KO in or near the eighth round. Frampton v Avalos is live on ITV1 from 10pm, preceded by the undercard on ITV4.",

But the UK as a country came third – behind the US and Germany - when companies were asked to name the best nation for producing work-ready graduates. The table – the Global Employability University Ranking published by the International New York Times – also showed that universities in Asian countries were rapidly gaining ground on their western counterparts. Asian universities claimed 20 per cent of the top 150 places in 2014 compared with only 10 per cent when the tables were first published in 2010. The other British universities in the top 20 were University College London, in 14th place, Imperial College London, in 15th, and Edinburgh, 18th.

Employers were asked to rank universities against a range of criteria including their production of graduates who are ready to work and their links with business.

Jonathan Thompson, of Amityville, New York, punched 4-year-old Adonis Reed so hard in the stomach when the boy refused to take a nap that the youngster died as the result of a lacerated liver. At the time, Reed was living with his godmother, Lakisha Pitt, who was dating Thompson. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jonathan Thompson (left) has pleaded guilty to second degree murder after beating Adonis Reed (right) to death . Gone too soon: Reed (above with an unidentified relative) was living with his godmother Lakisha Pitt at the time of his death, who was dating Thompson . The boy's 6-year-old sister was also living at the house. Thompson, 34, had confessed to the killing just days after it happened in January of 2013, but in an odd twist was recently suing his former lawyer, and almost every agency connected with the case, claiming a 'clear conspiracy' by all to violate his rights. In addition to a stay of his trial he was also asking for $500 million. According to Newsday, the suit also claimed that Reed died not because of the beating he suffered at the hands of Thompson, but rather from 'overzealous resuscitation efforts by first responders and medical malpractice at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip.' Beaten to death: Reed was just 4-years-old when he died after suffering fatal injuries to his liver . Anger: Reed's mother Linda Daniel is upset Child Protective Services placed the boy with his godmother since Thompson, who also lived at the house, was a convicted felon . Representing himself, Thompson decided to plead guilty yesterday, just one day before jury selection was set to begin. He likely changed his mind after medical evidence strongly suggested that the beating caused the death, as opposed to any problems with Reed's medical care. Suffolk County Court Judge Barbara Kahn agreed to sentence Thompson to 15 years to life in prison. The young boy's grandmother, Linda Daniels, said she was happy Thompson pleaded guilty yesterday, but felt his sentence was too lenient. She was also upset that Suffolk Child Protective Services placed Reed in his godmother's care to begin with and did not do a background check on her felon boyfriend.",

        "article": "George Zimmerman is speaking out about the Trayvon Martin killing for the first time in an interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity. Friends and family members have told the neighborhood watch volunteer's side of the story since the controversial killing in February, but Zimmerman himself has remained silent. The interview comes one day after it was revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he was in jail at the time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Opening up: Donations poured in on George Zimmerman's fundraising website after he spoke exclusively to Fox News's Sean Hannity . He went into hiding because he received . thousands of death threats after he was initially not arrested because . he claimed he opened fire on the unarmed teen in self defense. 'Zimmerman will open up about what happened the night of Trayvon Martin’s death and his experience in the aftermath of the fatal shooting,' Fox News says. The hour-long interview will air tonight at 9pm on Fox News. Zimmerman appeared alongside his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, and talked about what led up to and what followed the shooting. The interview is the culmination of several months of work by Hannity to land the exclusive interview. Uproar: With all that has been said about the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, the public had never heard Zimmerman's story from the man himself . In 18 days in jail, George Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 on personal expenses, according to court filings by his lawyer, Mark O'Mara. Those expenses include: . Credit card bills: $7,000 . Money for bail: $5,000 . Car payments and rental: $4,300 . Repaying loan from parents: $3,000 . Land line telephone: $2,500 . Rent: $1,900 . Food: $1,300 . AT&T wireless Internet: $1,300 . Gas: $800 . Jail commissary: $800 . Jail calling cards: $600 . Utilities: $400 . New phones: $300 each . In April, at the height over the public uproar over the shooting, Zimmerman called Hannity and had an off-the-record conversation with him. The details of the call have never been made public. The interview is also expected to discuss the $200,000 in donations he received from supporters via a PayPal he set up on his site therealgeorgezimmerman.com. Court filings from O'Mara show that in 18 days, Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 to pay off credit card bills, buy phones, make car payments and pay for an Internet connection -- all of it while he was still in jail. Among the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports. In many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially from the PayPal account, . The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000 payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000. However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay down credit card bills -- $4,000 on their America Express bill alone. O'Mara says the bills were for expenses the Zimmerman incurred when they had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats. They used $4,400 to make payments on two cars and $1,500 to rent a third car. Gas was $800. Both Zimmerman and his wife Shellie bought new phones for $300 each and paid up front for a two-year contract. A telephone land line and AT&T Internet were installed at the Zimmermans' safe house for $2,500 and $1,300, respectively. All of these expenses, O'Mara argues, were 'judicious' use of the the cash sent by supporters. After the living expenses were covered, the Zimmermans kept $20,000 for additional cash and turned the rest -- $123,000 over to O'Mara to be put in a legal defense fund.",

        "article": "Hitler was a tax dodger who hid a vast fortune across several Swiss bank accounts, historians have discovered. Documents have emerged showing the dictator amassed hundreds of millions of pounds in today’s money, which he concealed from the German people. It appeared to vanish completely after his death, along with his substantial art collection. Scroll down for video . Hitler hid hundreds of millions of pounds across several Swiss banks, concealing his fortune from the German people . But historians have now managed to trace the money through tax documents and bank statements. They believe he was worth around 1.1billion Reichsmarks, the equivalent of £3.6billion today. During his lifetime the Nazi leader insisted his public speeches only made him a small amount of money and that he did not even have a bank account. But documentary The Hunt For Hitler’s Missing Millions, to be aired tomorrow on Channel 5, will explore how he secretly gained a huge fortune. He refused to pay taxes, dodging £1.75million before passing a law that made him exempt. The book he wrote in prison, . Mein Kampf, generated one million Reichs-marks-per-year after Hitler . decreed that a copy be given to every married couple – paid for by the . government. Experts also claim the dictator wrote a secret will on the morning of his death, hoping to trick the German people into believing his humble claims. Hitler was leader of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany and orchestrated the execution of more than 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust. His aggressive foreign policy is believed to be the primary cause of the Second World War. He invaded Poland in September 1939, and it led to France and England declaring war. But he was finally defeated by the Allies in 1945, following which he ended his life. Hitler was a dictator. And his radical ideology sought to create an Aryan race of superior beings and he was responsible for mass genocide in his concentration camps. He killed himself on April 30 1945 to avoid capture, after giving his deputies strict instructions on what to do with his body so it wouldn’t be found and humiliated by his enemies. And he also told them what he wanted done with his various assets, some of which still remains a mystery. In it he dedicated five pages to a political diatribe against the Jews and just three to his personal will. He presented himself as almost penniless, writing: ‘What I own belongs, as so far as it is of any value at all, to the party.’ There was no further mention of his . wealth, only that his relatives should be given enough ‘to sustain a . simple middle-class life’. It was to be administered . by Hitler’s private secretary and fellow Nazi, Martin Bormann, who was . witness to the will and named as Hitler’s sole executive. However . Bormann was shot dead not long after Hitler committed suicide. The . will was intercepted by Allied forces as a suspected Nazi tried to . smuggle it out of the country, hidden in the shoulder pad of his jacket. Historian Dr Chris Whetton said: ‘He loved money. He just wasn’t prepared to do much for it.’ The Nazi leader also copyrighted his image, meaning he even earned royalties every time a post-age stamp with his face on it was sold. Herman Rothman, a retired British Intelligence Officer was among those to discover and translate the will. He said: ‘We were absolutely shocked by what we found. I think the private will was also for consump-tion by the German people. He wanted to show in his private will he had very little. 'I always felt he thought about it very, very clearly, he wanted to show the people he had no benefits, that his life was purely devoted entirely to the wealth of the German people.’",

        "article": "After holders Manchester City were dumped out of the Capital One Cup on Wednesday, Manuel Pellegrini may not wish to be alerted to the League Cup-winning manager's curse that has developed since February 2007. Between the 2007 and 2013 competitions, five out of the six managers to win the tournament  left their club less than a year later. The Chilean boss should not be feeling the heat just five months after winning the Premier League, but the list of managers to have lost their jobs so soon after lifting the League Cup in recent years is a reminder of how quickly things can change in football.

Sacked on  Feb 4 2014 (less than a year later). 2013-14: Manuel Pellegrini  – won cup with Manchester City in March 2014. Back in February 2007, few could have foreseen that Jose Mourinho, who had just won the Carling Cup for the Premier League champions would be gone just seven months later. A year later, Juande Ramos lifted the trophy for Tottenham after a 2-1 win against Chelsea, which was meant to herald a bright new dawn for Spurs. Eight months on the Spaniard was unceremoniously given the boot after a run of poor results. Sir Alex Ferguson bucked the trend by winning the tournament in 2009 and 2010 and remaining in his post until 2013, but since then the curse has continued. In 2011, Birmingham defeated Arsenal in the final but suffered relegation from the Premier League just three months later. The following month, manager Alex McLeish resigned  via email. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish won the Reds' first trophy in six years in 2012 when he managed the team to  League Cup victory after a penalty shoot-out win against Cardiff. It didn't do him much good – he was sacked less than three months later. Michael Laudrup was the manager to lift the League Cup in February 2013 as he led Swansea to the first major trophy in the club's history. Alex McLeish masterminded Birmingham's 2011 League Cup success but his side were relegated three months afterwards and he resigned . Jose Mourinho has been a victim of the curse - he left Chelsea seven months after the 2007 League Cup win . The Dane was sacked less than a year after the success. Pellegrini and City are still fighting on three fronts, and the Chilean will not be panicking, but in the unforgiving world of modern football, his team's results may have to improve quickly if he is to avoid the League Cup manager's curse.",

        "article": "Detectives investigating suspected terrorists and paedophiles will have the power to force internet companies to hand over details of computer-users under new laws being introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May. The move is the latest round in a power battle between Mrs May and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over the so-called ‘snoopers’ charter’, which would greatly increase the power of the police and intelligence services to monitor communications between suspects. Last night, Mrs May said the move would boost national security, but complained that Mr Clegg was still blocking her from taking further vital steps on the grounds of civil liberties. Scroll down for video . Power battle: Home Secretary Theresa May has clashed with Nick Clegg over the so-called 'snooper's charter' But the Lib Dems hit back, saying there was ‘no chance’ of any ‘illiberal’ measures being allowed on to the statute book. Under the Home Secretary’s plans, to be included in the Anti-Terrorism and Security Bill, internet service providers will be obliged to help police and MI5 track suspicious individuals by retaining information that helps them match Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to individual users. IP addresses are numbers that identify each device connected to the internet. If police seize a computer that has been shared between individuals, they will be able to demand the information that will single out the key suspects. It will also allow them to track anyone using websites showing child-abuse images. But despite Mrs May’s lobbying, police still cannot demand that internet companies tell them which websites were being viewed by suspects. The move comes just days after Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, Scotland Yard’s head of counter-terrorism, said the ‘massively stretched’ police were forced to rely on old-fashioned methods such as following suspects because the targets were finding it easier to evade electronic monitoring. Mrs May said: ‘Loss of the capabilities on which we have always relied is the great danger we face. The Bill provides the opportunity to resolve the very real problems that exist around IP resolution and is a step in the right direction towards bridging the overall communications data capability gap. But I believe we need to make further changes to the law. ‘It is a matter of national security and we must keep on making the case for the Communications Data Bill until we get the changes we need.’ Internet giants were asked at a Downing Street summit last month to hand over the personal details of extremists they catch posting offensive material online, such as beheading videos . An aide to Mr Clegg said he supported the move on IP addresses, but continued to oppose plans to allow the security services to access records of every website visited by targets and who they communicate with on social media sites. The aide also accused Mrs May of previously making ‘deeply misleading’ claims that the Lib Dems had ‘put children’s lives at risk’ by blocking the ‘snoopers’ charter’. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘It is good news that the Home Office has finally got round to producing proposals on this after being repeatedly asked by Nick Clegg. These can now be agreed and acted on in the upcoming Bill. ‘This is exactly the kind of thing we need to take action on, rather than proposing an unnecessary, unworkable and disproportionate snoopers’ charter. There is absolutely no chance of that illiberal Bill coming back under the Coalition Government – it’s dead and buried.’ As The Mail on Sunday disclosed, internet giants were asked at a Downing Street summit last month to hand over the personal details – including IP addresses – of extremists they catch posting offensive material online, such as beheading videos.",

        "article": "The extent of Toni Kroos’ contract stand-off with Bayern Munich has placed all the Barclays Premier League’s top clubs on standby for a £25million summer scramble to sign him. Bayern bosses are digging in their heels over Kroos’ bold bid to more than double his earnings from just over £60,000 a week to around £150,000 and have bluntly told him talks over a new deal will remain on hold until he lowers his sights. The 24-year-old Germany midfielder was even relegated to the bench for the first time in two months on Sunday, in a further escalation of his Allianz Arena woes that has alerted all the Premier League big guns. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Bayern's recent brilliant performance against Eintracht Frankfurt . Toni the target: Premier League clubs are very interested in Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos (right) Sportsmail revealed just over a week . ago how Manchester United manager David Moyes had been first to react to . growing uncertainty over Kroos’ future by watching Bayern’s game at . Borussia Monchengladbach with the 24-year old’s agent. Should . there still be no thaw in relations at the end of the season, it seems . certain Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and even Liverpool will . declare their hand and make it clear to Kroos they are prepared to meet . his wage demands. In an . intriguing sub-plot, there have even been claims in Germany that Arsenal . missed out on prime target Julian Draxler because Bayern have lined him . up as Kroos’ replacement in the summer. Former . Middlesbrough and Barnsley striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, who works as a TV . pundit in Norway and Germany, tweeted: ‘Bayern Munich managed to stop . the Draxler deal by saying “we take him in the summer.”’ Sub standard? Kroos was dropped to the bench for Bayern's match on Sunday . Reacting badly: Kroos was not happy at being taken off recently against Stuttgart . Fjortoft’s claim is as yet unsubstantiated, but what is beyond doubt is that Bayern will not be dictated to over extending a contract that has less than 18 months to run. Kroos is currently in the middle band of earners, whose pay ranges from £50,000 to £80,000 a week, but feels he should be elevated to the elite section, where the likes of Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery pocket around £150,000. Bayern are about to add Borussia Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski to the top earners but are determined to maintain the balance of their pay scale on current lines and are adamant Kroos cannot move up. Bayern buy? Munich have reportedly lined up Schalke's Julian Draxler (centre) to replace Kroos . Their hardline stance has received influential backing from former Germany midfielder Gunter Netzer, who reinforced the view that Kroos will have to climb down or possibly consider a fresh start in the Premier League next season. ‘I would advise Toni Kroos not to overplay his hand,’ he said. ‘There are a few players who cannot be replaced, but he is not one of them. He is playing a risky game at Bayern. The club are determined not to pay huge wages to all their players, in order to stay healthy financially. ‘This could become a situation where Kroos forces Bayern to set an example. He might be overrating himself a bit with his wage demands, in that they might not reflect his worth to the team. He would be wise to have a good look at the squad and rethink his situation.’ Watching brief: David Moyes (centre) was at Borussia Monchengladbach vs Bayern Munich to see Kroos first hand . Interested: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (top left), Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (top left), Arsenal's Arsene Wenger (bottom left) and Manchester City chief Manuel Pellegrini are all monitoring Kroos' situation . The prospects of a compromise with Bayern have hardly been helped by signs of petulance on the pitch. Kroos threw his gloves to the floor in anger after being substituted at Stuttgart last week and promptly found himself demoted to the bench for Sunday’s crushing win over Eintracht Frankfurt. It is being viewed as evidence that manager Pep Guardiola, like his boardroom bosses, will take no nonsense from a player who has been an integral part of Bayern’s recent dominance but is now embroiled in a dangerous game of brinkmanship over his future.",

Corporal Stewart ‘Bulletproof’ McLaughlin, 27, was killed by rocket fire after leading a succession of daredevil charges towards Argentine machine-gun and sniper posts during the Battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982. The Paras routed enemy positions and secured a heroic victory. Courage under fire: Cpl Stewart 'bulletproof' McLaughlin was killed by rocket fire after leading a succession of daredevil charges during the Battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982 . The capture of Mount Longdon proved hugely significant. The peak overlooks the Falklands’ capital, Port Stanley, and within two days of the battle UK soldiers were able to force the Argentinians to surrender. After the battle, Cpl McLaughlin’s commanding officer put him forward for a medal. But the soldier’s family claim the handwritten citation was lost before it could be typed and sent to London for approval. The march to No 10 in July is in protest against the Ministry of Defence’s refusal to consider a retrospective medal. The Prime Minister has the authority to grant awards to veterans in exceptional circumstances. After the battle, Cpl McLaughlin's commanding officer put him forward for a medal. But the soldier's family claim the handwritten citation was lost before it could be typed and sent to London for approval . Decisive: The capture of Mount Longdon proved hugely significant and within two days of the battle UK soldiers were able to force the Argentinians to surrender . Cpl McLaughlin’s commanding officer, . Lieutenant General Sir Hew Pike, has now taken the unprecedented step of . writing a new citation, insisting the soldier deserves formal . recognition and that his actions were ‘absolutely instrumental’ in . determining the outcome of the battle. ‘At one point he ran forward under fire . to pull a wounded man back into cover by grabbing his webbing [a . waistband with storage pouches], his example reassuring those around him . that he did not seem fazed by anything and if they too were hit he . would get them back to relative safety,’ writes Sir Hew. A commemorative plaque for Cpl McLaughlin close to the spot where he fell at Mount Longdon . ‘McLaughlin realised that it was only . a matter of time before they incurred more casualties so he shouted, . “I’ll count one, two, three, then we all go.” 'About a minute later he did the countdown and shouted, “Come on lads, I’m bulletproof, follow me!” ‘He then ran forward towards the gunfire, followed by the rest of the section, who all reached the cover of the rocks unscathed. Members of the section commented later that it was the bravest thing they had ever seen. ‘Cpl McLaughlin’s leadership through a terrible battle, of which his young soldiers had no previous experience, inspired confidence in all and sustained those who might otherwise have faltered.’ Cpl McLaughlin, from Liverpool, was among 23 Paras killed that night. After the battle, regimental officers recommended which soldiers deserved medals – but Army top brass ruled that only those citations typed on the appropriate forms would be considered. In the end, just nine awards were made. The soldier’s son, also called Stewart, said: ‘At the time they didn’t have a typewriter, so they liberated an Olivetti from the Argentinians. ‘There was then a mad rush to type up as many of the citations as possible before the Paras came home. ‘A citation was never typed up for my father so I’d like the Prime Minister to right a wrong that has stood for so long. Mr Cameron is our only hope because the Ministry of Defence doesn’t consider appeals for medals.’ Para's evacuate wounded comrades from Mount Longdon . The Prime Minister can make extraordinary awards. In 2012, Mr Cameron announced that sailors who delivered supplies to Russia during the Second World War should receive the Arctic Star. The Ministry of Defence said: ‘Citations for operational gallantry awards are written at the time of the operation and there are clear opportunities to ensure any omissions are addressed at the time. ‘Any changes now would undermine the integrity of the awards.’",

NHS staff will be urged to join weight-watching groups and take out gym memberships in the fight against obesity crisis, the chief executive will announce this week. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, wants the 1.35million employees to be part of a national effort to highlight its dangers. He will put forward sweeping changes, including moves to reduce the sale of high-sugar and high-fat products on hospital premises. During the five-year 'forward view' for the health service, he will also say hospital trusts should offer healthy food for their staff 24 hours a day. Only a quarter of hospitals offer healthy food to night staff, which means they have to rely on vending machines and microwave meals. 'For the largest employer in Europe, which is dealing with the health of our people, that is appalling,' an NHS insider told the Observer. A senior NHS source, speaking ahead of Stevens's report, said it was time for the NHS to 'up its game' on obesity. 'We were warned over a decade ago that unless there was decisive action, the NHS would be picking up the tab for a sharp rise in avoidable illness. That warning wasn't heeded and the NHS is now on the hook for 12 years of inaction. 'Obesity has to come off the 'too hard to do' list. The health of millions of children and the sustainability of the NHS depend on a radical upgrade in prevention, starting with the billion-pound problem of obesity.' Mr Stevens hopes that other public institutions, including schools, will take a similar line. One in five young people and one in four adults in the UK now suffer from obesity, which each year causes 34,000 deaths and costs the NHS more than £1billion. Last year almost 11,000 people – 8,000 of them women – were admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of obesity. Warnings about its rise, and spiralling costs, were issued in a government-commissioned report by Sir Derek Wanless in 2002. One in five young people and one in four adults in the UK now suffer from obesity, which each year causes 34,000 deaths .",

Jose Aguinelo dos Santos was born on July 7, 1888, just two months after slavery was abolished in Brazil - the last country in the world to outlaw the trade. Yet the batchelor, who never married or had children, still walks without a stick, eats four meals a day and has no health problems - despite smoking a packet of cigarettes a day for the last 50 years. 126 not out: Jose Aguinelo dos Santos, who claims he was born on July 7, 1888, could be the oldest living person ever . Mr dos Santos was born just two months after slavery was abolished in Brazil - the last country in the world to outlaw the trade . Jose - known simply as Ze - was 26 when World War I broke out, and already a pensioner at 65 when Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the British throne. He was 52 when Brazil football legend Pele was born - and 62 when Brazil last hosted the World Cup, in 1950. One of five children to an African slave woman, Jose was born in a slave compound in the town of Pedra Branca in the state of Ceara, north-east Brazil. He was among hundreds of slave families who continued to live there, even after being granted their freedom. He later travelled south to the state of Sao Paulo, where he spent most of his life working on a coffee plantation in the town of Bauru. Now a resident of an old people's home in the same town, Jose likes to tell jokes and sing, hates having a bath, and never misses his daily plate of rice and beans. Mr dos Santos spent most of his life working on a coffee plantation in the town of Bauru. He now lives in and old people's home .

And he told Brazil's G1 website there is no secret to living a long life: 'The truth is that you just keep getting older. You take each stage at a time. 'If I got to this age it's because I've lived a lot, that's all.' Mariana Silva, psychologist at the Vila Vicentina home, said Jose has no health problems and is so lucid he still amuses other residents by cracking one-liners. She said: 'He's one of our most with-it residents. 'He doesn't have high cholesterol, diabetes or high blood pressure. The only medicine he takes are vitamins and a tablet to give him an appetite, which you can lose with old age. 'When he's on his own he likes to sing. None of us know the songs he sings. They're from a time no-one else remembers. 'He doesn't like to take a bath every day and it's sometimes impossible to get him to the shower. When he puts his foot down, that's it. No-one can get him in there.' Jose, who arrived at the home in 2001, received his birth certificate last month after living his entire life without any documents. A team of experts arrived on his birth date after researching his past and interviewing him about his earliest memories, during which he was able to describe the slave compound perfectly. The old people's home now hopes to provide conclusive evidence that he is the world's oldest man through 'Carbon-14' dating. The home's president, Jose Roberto Pires, said they are determined to do the test even though it costs around £13,000. But he added: 'We are trying to find a way to do it without having to pay. This is very important. We believe the world's oldest ever person is living here with us, and this is the only way we can really prove it.'",

        "article": "EastEnders is 'twice as white' as the real East End according to the head of the BBC Trust, who has called for the corporation to do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain . Acting head of the BBC Trust Diane Coyle, said the popular BBC One soap is also too young and has too many people born in the UK to be an accurate reflection of an area such as Walthamstow, one of the boroughs on which the fictional Albert Square is based. In her first public speech since taking over as chair of the BBC’s governing body Miss Coyle - who is in the running to replace Lord Patten as head of the trust - said the programme did not provide an accurate picture of modern day Britain. EastEnders is 'twice as white' as the real East End according to the head of the BBC Trust, who has called for the corporation to do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain . She said: 'The Audience Council figures suggested that there are almost twice as many white people living in fictional E20 as in real life E17, while the population of EastEnders tends to be younger than their real life counterparts and more likely to have been born in the UK.' Ms Coyle said the BBC's Audience Council for England 'compared the population of Walthamstow in East London with Walford - the fictional home of EastEnders' She said it would be 'daft' for the show to be a 'perfect replica' of the real world, but said it was 'important to ask whether the BBC can do more in its popular output to provide an authentic portrayal of life in modern Britain'. In her speech at the London School of Economics, which will be widely seen as an application to replace Lord Patten who stepped down in May, she said the BBC’s independence was 'not as secure as it might seem' and that it had 'become more and more entangled with parts of the machinery of government, Parliament and the State in all sorts of other, more or less obvious ways'. She said there needed to be 'clearer terms of engagement' over what parliament has scrutiny over, otherwise 'there is a real risk that the BBC could in the future end up looking over its shoulder trying to please politicians rather than focusing on licence fee payers'. Ms Coyle, an economist by profession whose husband is a BBC journalist, said there was 'every reason' to think the licence fee was 'sustainable' and called for a 'full, open public debate' about funding. Her . comments – made on the same day comedian Lenny Henry repeated his . criticism that there are too few people from ethnic minorities on . television – are based on research carried out by the Audience Council . for England. The BBC plans to spend £2.1million of . licence fee money on fast-tracking ethnic minority talent onto the . screen with a new ‘diversity’ committee. Director-general . Mr Hall said the corporation had ‘to do more’ to increase ethnic . minority representation both on and off camera. He . said the ‘diversity creative talent fund’ would help ‘fast-track’ certain shows onto the screen and create a series of development . programmes aimed at encouraging future commissioners and executives from . ethnic minority backgrounds. The director-general said he wanted to . see ethnic minorities account for 15 per cent of air talent in the next . three years and said he would also set ‘local off-air targets’ in London, . Birmingham, Manchester and Leicester to reflect the population of those . cities. Actor Lenny Henry, who has criticised the TV and film industry in the past for not providing a 'fair and honest reflection of our society', has signed up to the committee to help advise the corporation . He also said he wanted those from ethnic minority backgrounds to account for 15 per cent of senior staff by 2020. Actor Lenny Henry, who has criticised the TV and film industry in the past for not providing a ‘fair and honest reflection of our society’, has signed up to the committee to help advise the corporation on its representation of ethnic minorities.

'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago. We are waiting for them.' Scroll down for video . 'Everything is ready for execution - we are waiting for them': The 'death island' prisons boss Ahmad Yuspahruddin (pictured), chief of the Central Java penitentiary division which governs Nusakambangan Island is prepared to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Children play in the water across from 'death island' or Nusakambangan (pictured, in the background) this week in central Java, where preparations have intensified for the arrival of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan to be placed in isolation cells and then executed by firing squad .

Tightened security: Cilicap police chief Ulung Sampurna Jaya (pictured) has his troops ready to form a firing squad to execute foreigners including the two Australians and has tightened security around Nusakambangan ahead of the expected intense media focus on Bali Nine duo Chan and Sukumaran's arrival . Prison island: Despite white beaches and  tropical scenery Nusakambangan Island (above) off the southern tip of central Java, Indonesia, has been a prison island since 1905, with six operational facilities set in dense rain forest and rubber plantations. Condemned men are shot on the beach or in the 'grove' in the island's centre . The police chief at the major port to the island, Cilicap police commander Ulung Sampurna Jaya, also confirmed the firing squad was 'ready at any time of instruction' to carry out the execution. 'We are only waiting of the instruction. We have already secured the entire area of Cilacap with our troops,' he said. 'We are preparing Batu Penitentiary to isolate the duo inmates, we still await from Kerobokan Bali, when they are ready,' Yuspahruddin said to journalists. Condemned men: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured in a Bali holding cell) are desperately waiting for a reprieve from their scheduled transfer to central Java and execution. The pair has put their faith in lawyer Dr Todung Lubis who will challenge their failed clemency bid in a Jakarta court next Tuesday .

This was despite the fact the execution has been delayed ahead of a court hearing next Tuesday in Jakarta to challenge Indonesian president Joko Widodo's rejection of the two Australian's application for clemency. Chan and  Sukumaran were sentenced to death in February 2006, less than a year after being arrested attempting to smuggle from Indonesia to Australia 8.3kg of heroin valued at around $4 million strapped to the bodies of the young Australians who became known as the 'Bali 9'. The drug operation ringleaders appealed  to the newly elected Indonesian president Widodo last year to have their death sentences commuted to life, but he refused.

        "article": "Some of the very first cells to form life on Earth could be hiding on the moon. This is according to British scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows. They claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment - a time when Earth was bombarded by asteroids, and chunks of its material were thrown into space. Some of the very first cells to form life on Earth could be hiding on the moon.This is according to British scientists who believe evidence of the origins of life may be trapped beneath ancient lunar lava flows. Pictured is an artist's impression of the Earth as viewed from the lunar surface . 'Unlike the Earth, the moon has been geologically quiet for billions of years, meaning there is a good chance these organic and volatile records remain relatively intact,' Richard Matthewman from Imperial College London told Maddie Stone at Motherboard. Life began on Earth around four billion years ago, but the planet's geologic record only goes back 3.8 billion years. The cells and molecules that formed before have been erased through plate tectonics. Scientists want to find them as they could provide crucial evidence to how organic molecules transformed into life systems. In April, physicists tested what would happen if rock containing microscopic fossils from Earth were to be fired into space and smash into the lunar surface. None of the fossils survived perfectly intact in the University of Kent study, but being able to recover anything at all was still promising for the scientists. The scientists claim the molecules were flung towards the moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment - a time when Earth was bombarded by asteroids, and chunks of its material were thrown into space . The latest study, however, shows that these fossils can survive and now researchers are attempting to find out exactly how long. 'We think a lava flow might be a good way to do that,' Professor Matthewman told Motherboard said. The Imperial College team heated a range simple organic compounds and complex polymers up to 700°C in a vacuum. They also added JCS-1 - a synthetic mixture of minerals the mimic's the lunar surface. Without JCS-1, the organic materials were destroyed. But in its presence, they were able to survive the intense heat. However, so far, no one has found an Earth meteorite on the moon. Professor Matthewman said that if scientists found a series of lava flows with terrestrial meteorites inside, they could find the first appearance of recognisable life. Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life. They say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents (stock image shown) in the early Earth, billions of years ago . One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA.",

        "article": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has said he believes the owner of the Washington Redskins would consider changing the team's name because it causes offence to Native Americans. Goodell joined the debate on Sunday during a question-and-answer session with Dallas season ticket-holders before the Cowboys' game against the Redskins. The commissioner said he grew up in Washington and considered everything about the name to be something that honored the tradition of Native Americans. Change: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he believes Washington owner Daniel Snyder is 'way down the road' in consideration of name change . 'But I think we also have to be sensitive enough to at least listen and try to see what it is we can do if we're insulting any element of our fan base, or non-fan base for that matter,' Goodell said. 'I think Dan Snyder is way down the road on doing that. I'm confident he's listening. I'm confident he feels strongly about the name but also wants to do the right thing.' The Redskins were playing for the first time since President Barack Obama reignited the debate by saying he would 'think about changing' the name if he were the team's owner. He said: 'The name is just simply inappropriate. It is offensive to a lot of people.' Debate: Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo (9) lines up behind center Travis Frederick (72) during the second half of an NFL football game against the Washington Redskins Sunday . Debate: Zena 'Chief Z' Williams signs autographs. President Barack Obama said that if he owned the Washington Redskins, he would 'think about changing' the team name . Congressman Tom Cole - a Republican - has called it 'offensive.' The Oneida Indian Nation, which ran a radio advertisement in Dallas to protest the . name, is also planning to meet with NFL representatives over the . issue. A small group of protesters gathered . near the stadium hours before kickoff carrying signs that read 'Stop . Perpetuating Racism' and 'Redskins (equals) 81 years racism.' Pro change: Ray Halbritter, a senior leader of the Oneida Indian Nation in New York state, speaks at a symposium in Washington, DC in favor of changing the name . Support: A Washington Redskins fan shows his support for re-branding the US capital's beloved American football team . 'I'm . glad the president took a stand,' said Yolanda Blue Horse, of Dallas, a . member of the Lakota Nation. 'If Dan Snyder wanted to honor Native . Americans there's better ways to do that rather than Redskins.' One . of the protesters, Juan Mancias, drove from his home in the San Antonio . area with flag of the American Indian Movement, which began in 1968. He said he protested at a Cowboys and Redskins game at Texas Stadium in 1997. Jack Flack, a Redskins fan from Washington who attended the game with friends, said he would change the name to Washington Senators. 'I mean, if the president's weighing in, it's probably time for change,' Flack said. However, some Cowboys fans saw no reason for change. 'It's a tradition,' said Stephanie Smith of Houston. 'It's how it should be.' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones backed Snyder during the session with Goodell. 'It would be a real mistake to think that Dan ... in any way has a lack of sensitivity regarding somebody's feelings,' Jones said. 'I can promise you that.' It was adopted by the football team in 1933 when co-owner George Preston Marshall renamed the Boston Braves the Redskins, and the name followed the team to Washington. Many U.S. sports teams were named after indigenous peoples but in recent years the names have proved more offensive.",

But it has been revealed that the two stores have one unexpected thing in common: their level of customer service. An independent guide to London shops has awarded both retailers a rating of just two out of five for their customer service. Not so posh: Luxury department store Prada, who show their collections on the world's most famous catwalks, have been rated the same at Primark for customer service . With the designer Bond Street store attracting the likes of Victoria Beckham and Gwyneth Paltrow, with an average handbag costing around £700, customers should expect an excellent level of service. But in fact, the research by fashion journalist Tracy Rose and her husband Russell for the third edition of their shopping guide, Fashion Fabulous London, reveals a surprisingly low score for the iconic Italian brand. Bargain basement: Primark, which copies Prada's designs and sells them for a fraction of the price, received the same rating as the designer store . The 100-year-old brand, . whose designs often inspire cheap product ranges by bargain retailers such as Primark, received a much worse customer service review . than it's cheaper counterpart. Tracy Rose, who visited the store, said: 'Once there, it seemed that the sales assistant had problems with person recognition, or maybe that she had come off a trance training course.' Famous fans: The likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Beyonce (both pictured attending Prada's costume gala) are huge fans of the 100-year-old brand . Writing about her visit to the 80,000 square foot Oxford Street Primark store, she commented that the service at the till was 'actually very friendly', which led to the service rating being doubled. The Roses carried out reviews of 200 different shops in the capital and decided that good service speaks for itself and therefore they judge it accordingly. Tracy Rose is a milliner and a fashion journalist on BBC, lTV, Channel 4 , Five, Sky News, GMTV, London Tonight and was a diarist for London Fashion Week.

Homeware giant Ikea yesterday announced it was to start selling the Lovbacken three-legged side table, more than half a century after the original went on sale in Sweden.

        "article": "Full time: Chris Jarvis said he was expected to work from 9.30am-6pm . When you sign up to do a spot of work shadowing to 'gain an insight into the business', you don't expect to be working for nine hours a day doing the work of a full-time - and fully-paid - employee. So Chris Jarvis took legal action against entertainment and electronics giant Sony when it refused to pay him for four months' work. And the company has paid the its 'unpaid intern' £4,600 after the video games design graduate took his case to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). Mr Jarvis, a video games design graduate from Milton Keynes, signed up to do an internship at Sony Computer Entertainment in Cambridge last September. He signed up for the role of '3D Environment Artist intern'  and expected that he would be shadowing a Sony designer to learn about the company. But he found himself in the office from 9.30am to 6pm every day, testing 3D artwork for games. 'I was basically clicking buttons to make sure the pictures that had come in from China were working,' Mr Jarvis said. 'It's normally part of the Environment Artist's job - but it's time-consuming and boring work. The 25-year-old, who has a first class degree in Games Art and Design from Norwich University, 'politely informed' the . company that they owed him at least minimum wage of £6.19, considering . he was effectively working as a full-time employee. 'They were very dismissive and told me I was a volunteer and that's how I could work for free,' he said. Mr Jarvis said he was also making a daily round-trip commute of three-and-a-half hours to Sony's City . House base in Cambridge, a journey which the company agreed to cover in travel expenses. But he said that after the first month's payment, the travel expenses dried up. 'I was at the end of my overdraft and I didn't know what to do' said Mr Jarvis, who is now a lead graphic designer at Air Raid Clothing in Milton Keynes. 'So I looked into my rights and found that I was legally doing the work of an employee.' Unpaid: Mr Jarvis, then a recent graduate, expected his internship to involve a few months' shadowing a Sony designer . The case went to a tribunal, and the . $20billion company coughed up weeks before it was due to be heard. Sony ended up paying Mr Jarvis around £1,000 more than he originally asked for. The company also asked him to sign an agreement to keep quiet about the deal, which Mr Jarvis declined. Jasmine Patel of solicitors Leigh Day, who dealt with Mr Jarvis's case, said: 'In Chris’s case, it was very clear. We . looked at the fact that he had set hours, that he was expected to do the . work he was given and that he was required to do that work personally. She added that employees needed to have a better understanding of workers' rights. 'The only people who will be able to afford to do these internships are the ones who can pay to do them, while the people from poorer backgrounds can’t,' she said. 'On a legal level, under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, interns who meet the definition of a “worker” are entitled to be paid at least the national minimum wage. 'A key question when determining whether someone is a worker is whether the intern is obliged to perform work or services for the company and whether the organisation is obliged to provide it – i.e. a mutually of obligations. 'If the intern is doing work which is of value to the company this may also be a good indication that the intern is actually a worker and should be paid. Work experience: Mr Jarvis undertook the internship at Sony Computer Entertainment in Cambridge from September till December 2012 . 'These cases are very case specific . but where there is a mutuality of obligations, someone is really . providing value to the company and the internship is for quite a long . period - say six months - there will probably be a higher chance that . they will be a worker and therefore should be being paid. 'You could argue that someone who . comes in every single day and makes the tea should eventually be paid . for that service if they’re proving to be of value for the company, but . these cases will in the end be decided on a case by case basis.' According to Government regulations, . employers do not have to pay the minimum wage if an internship only . involves observing an employee and no work is carried out by the intern. Charities, voluntary organisations associated bodies and statutory bodies do not have to pay volunteers, but other businesses are not allowed to refuse to pay a worker by claiming they are a volunteer. About 100,000 young people are thought . to be working for no pay and 100 companies are being investigated by . HMRC for allegedly breaching minimum wage laws. Sony declined to comment.",

She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs. Vote Romney: In 2012 the Clueless star took to Twitter to show how she would be voting in the presidential election . The actress lent her support to Mitt Romney in 2012 by re-tweeting his posts .

The New York Post recently reported that Dash is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series. The premise of the show, which has the tentative title of 'Stacey . Dash is Normal' - follows Dash's life as a Republican single mother . living in Hollywood. Dash became a conservative darling in 2012 when she started speaking out about politics after revealing that, unlike many African American voters, she supported Romney. ‘I believe that if you stand for something you have to stand for it, you can't hide behind it or it won't get done,’ she told the Fox and Friends crew last month.

She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to endorsing his 2012 opponent 'because of the state of the country'.

        "article": "A pensioner who was paralysed 11 years ago is claiming she can now walk again after experiencing a 'miracle' at a church in southern Italy. Michelina Comegna, 74, was struck by the 'miracle' during morning mass at a church in modern Pompei. 'I took communion and instantly felt a fire going from my feet up my legs and my whole body. At the same time, I was overcome by an intense scent of flowers', she said. Michelina Comegna, 74, was struck by the miracle during morning mass at the Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei . I forgot I was in church and looked around, convinced my clothes were on fire. I was covered in sweat, it was dripping from my head like water. I told my husband I was feeling an intense joy, and I needed to walk,' she said reported Gazzetta del Sud On Line. 'It was so strong, that I began to become scared. I forgot that I was in a church; because of the burning sensation I thought I was on fire.' In April 2003 she was paralysed following breast cancer surgery and a brain aneurysm that left her bed-ridden for three years. A mastectomy and several cycles of chemotherapy followed, and she spent the next 11 years in and out of a wheelchair, afflicted with partial paralysis. 'I took communion and instantly felt a fire going from my feet up my legs and my whole body. At the same time, I was overcome by an intense scent of flowers', she said (file photo) Ms Comegna has attended the Shrine of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompei for years, but says it was not until taking communion at a service last month that her prayers were answered. Vicar Giuseppe Adamo confirmed he had witnessed the incident, although remained cautious about declaring a miracle and said the church was waiting for a medical report, reported The Local. Archbishop Tommaso Caputo, who is in charge of the cathedral, also urged caution. 'We must wait for conclusive scientific evidence. 'While many prodigious events have taken place in this sanctuary by the intercession of the Virgin Mary, it is up to medical science to produce the evidence to confirm them'. But Ms Comegna’s husband, Giovanni Passaro, insists his wife has received a miracle. 'I have seen a great miracle...it changed everything,' he was quoted as saying. 'She got up and quickly walked towards the nave. I asked her to stop, but she went and had no sign of paralysis.' In February a 20-year-old US college student who was paralysed in a sporting accident says he received messages from God telling him the exact day he would walk again - and he did.",

Royal wave: The fresh-faced royal even waved at members of the public as she was sped through the gates . Busy: The Prince of Wales took time out from his breakneck festive schedule to attend the family lunch . Hard at work: Prince Charles spent yesterday touring Essex before returning to open an exhibition at the Science Museum . Pretty: A glamorous Princess Beatrice, who sported chic plum coloured nails, was driven through the gate by a security guard . Cheerful: The princess, who boasted hair glossy enough to rival Kate's, was another member of the family who seemed to be in good spirits . Hard-working: The Princess Royal is recently returned from trips to Canada, Ethiopia and Tanzania among others . Ready to eat: Prince Edward drove himself to the event and arrived with his close protection officer seated beside him . Cheerful: Prince Edward smiled as he drove through the gates for the Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch . Just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge like to dress their son in contemporary versions of traditional classics, so too with his reading material. As the 16-month-old prince was driven into Buckingham Palace, what looked like a copy of one of the Curious George books could be seen clutched in his fingers. Written by Hans Augusto and Margret Rey, the first book in the series, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys, made its debut in France in 1939, although the central character was called Fifi instead. When the book made its UK debut in 1941, the monkey, by then called George elsewhere, was rechristened Zozo to spare King George VI the embarrassment of sharing his name with an ape. By the time the second book in the series, Curious George Takes A Job, was published in 1947, the monkey had his name back and Curious George has remained Curious George ever since. Although the Reys wrote only the first seven books, such is their popularity, new books written and illustrated 'in the style' of the Reys have been appearing since 1998. Authors and illustrators of the second series include Mary O'Keefe Young, Martha Weston, Anna Grossnickle Hines, Michael Jensen, and Vipah Interactive. The Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch is a royal tradition and allows her to catch up with more distant relations, who are not invited to join her at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on the 25th. All of the senior royals, among them Prince Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex are expected at the country estate on Christmas Day and appear alongside the monarch at the traditional Christmas morning church service. One member of the Royal Family who appeared to be particularly looking forward to his lunch was Prince George, who was driven into the Palace beside his nanny, Maria Theresa Borrallo in the back of his parents' car. George, who was adorably smiley as he peered out of the window, is due to celebrate his second Christmas at Sandringham next week - and his last as an only child. The 16-month-old royal and his parents are also due to relocate to Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate where an extended nursery big enough for two babies has been prepared. George's new sibling is due in April and will live with his or her parents and older brother at the Norfolk property. The little prince will also have to share his nanny, who is expected to help care for the new arrival. Carole and Michael Middleton, who have spent a considerable amount of time with Prince George over the last year, are also expected to take a hand in raising the new arrival and will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Anmer Hall on Boxing Day. Low key: Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the husband of Princess Anne, was the only royal to arrive at the Palace on foot . Royal arrival: Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is driven into Buckingham Palace for lunch . Nice day out: Princess Alexandra of Kent arrives for lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace today . Obscure: Julia Oglivy, who is the wife of James Oglivy, the son of Sir Angus Ogilvy and Princess Alexandra, was at the lunch . Adorable: Lord Nicholas Windsor brought his adorable sons Albert and Leopold to meet their more famous relations . On their way: Timothy Taylor, Lady Helen Taylor and their daughter Estella arrive for the lunch party . Big arrival: Prince and Princess Michael of Kent drove in with their festively-dressed daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor . Stylish: 33-year-old Lady Gabriella teamed her scarlet dress with a pair of matching red coral earrings . Solemn: The Duke of Kent, who is the Queen's first cousin, looked solemn as he was driven into the Palace . Visiting: The festive lunch party was completed by Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband Daniel . She is almost as famous for her shiny locks as her cousin by marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge, but Princess Beatrice was taking no chances when it came to having lunch with the Queen. The 26-year-old royal was spotted emerging from a South Kensington hair salon, hours before being driven to Buckingham Palace for the royal family's annual pre-Christmas lunch. Beatrice, who is currently completing an internship, was caught up in the recent Sony scandal after details of her salary were among those leaked by hackers, believed to be linked to North Korea. Despite having endured a torrid few days as a result, the Princess was all smiles as she left the salon and appeared to be on cheerful form as she was driven into Buckingham Palace. Taking no chances: Princess Beatrice was spotted leaving a South Kensington hair salon early this morning . Looking good: The 26-year-old cut a glamorous figure as she strolled down the London street after her hair appointment .",

        "article": "While Liverpool are chasing MK Dons teenager Dele Alli, the central midfielder is aiming to replicate Kop hero Steven Gerrard by netting his first England goal against Germany. England Under 19s take on Germany in Dusseldorf on Monday evening and childhood Liverpool fan Alli is intent on following in the footsteps of his idol by scoring his first international goal against the nation's bitter rivals. Alli, who is also being monitored by Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United, said: 'It’s something I have been thinking about. Talent: 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli is being closely monitored by Liverpool among other suitors . Kop hero: Alli hopes to replicate Steven Gerrard by scoring his first international goal against Germany . I’ve had a few chances when I’ve been playing for England and I feel like they’ve been easy chances, but I’ve just been messing up so I can’t wait to get off the mark. I am actually a Liverpool fan and Gerrard is someone I look up to massively.' England U19 take on Germany U19's on Monday evening with the game being shown live on Eurosport 2 at 5pm. Gerrard's debut England strike back in 2001 was a beauty. David Beckham crossed from the right, Rio Ferdinand nodded the ball back and the Liverpool star controlled it with his chest before firing into the bottom left corner from 25 yards. In an unforgettable night it put England 2-1 ahead, just before half-time, before they went on to thrash the Germans 5-1. Alli added: 'If the ball drops for me on Monday like it did for him against Germany, I’m smashing it. If I get the goal I’ll obviously be happy but the win is all that matters.' Youth: The MK Dons youngster made his debut at the age of 16 in an FA Cup match against Cambridge City . MK Dons manager Karl Robinson claims Alli, who impressed during the Dons' emphatic 4-0 win over Manchester United in the Capital One Cup, is one of the most talented teenagers the country has ever produced. The club did well to hold on to him when Liverpool thought that a £3.5million offer would seal a move. If Alli's own description of himself is anything to go by, the Barclays Premier League is in for a treat when he finally makes it there. He joked: '[Tottenham midfielder] Harry Winks and I were talking about who I play like and he was trying to tell me I’m like Fernandinho but I’m not having that I’d prefer to think I’m a cross between Gerrard and Yaya Toure.'",

The rhino named Gertjie and his new friend Lammie the goat are seen fooling around and having lots of fun in an adorable two minute video filmed in Pretoria, South Africa. Gertjie nicknamed Little G and Lammie, who are both orphans, have bonded together at the Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre (HESC) where they both now live. Bond: Two orphans Little G the rhino and Lammie the goat have become 'inseparable' at the animal centre . The adorable footage was captured by assistant curator Karien Smit who wanted to show the friendship that has developed between the inseparable pair. The two minute video, which was uploaded one week ago by the HESC, has went viral on video-sharing website YouTube and so far it has been viewed over 520,000 times. Influence: Lammie the goat interacts with Little G the rhino during the amusing two minute video . Following: Little G the baby rhino follows and copies Lammie the kid goat in an adorable manner . During the video baby rhino Little G watches his friend Lammie the goat running up and down a winding dusty road in a typical haphazard way and he tries to copy him with memorable results. The two friends run around each other and also bump into each other in a spontaneous and carefree manner. The baby rhino's mother was poached on a farm near Hoedspruit and on May 8th this year the HESC received a call to say a baby white rhino was in need of a home. Assistant curator Ms Smit said the animal centre has been 'humbled' by the reaction of people from all over the world. Fooling: Lammie the goat also runs around in circles and Little G does his best to replicate the moves . Nice try: Little G the baby rhino tries to run around like the goat in the video but his size makes it difficult . 'None of us expected that the little guy would become so famous,' she said. 'Soon messages of support were flooding in from around the world. We were so surprised and extremely humbled.' Ms Smit said through Little G the rhino they had learned how 'generous and kind-hearted people can be'. She added, 'Thanks to all the support received Gertjie, with his new friend Lammie the goat is thriving. We would have never come this far without you.",

        "article": "For the City of New York, this fire hydrant may as well be gushing liquid gold. Over the course of the year the city earned $33,000 in parking fines by luring unwary drivers who thought they were parking perfectly legally. It doesn't help that that the fire hydrant which is positioned on the sidewalk is some seven feet away from the road. However, if a car comes within 15-feet of such a device, that car will usually receive a ticket and be taken to the pound. No parking allowed: A combination of road rules and confusing road markings is allowing the City of New York to rake in more than $33,000 a year in parking fines . To park or not to park: The painted white boxes make it appear to drivers that they're parking in a safe spot. In actual fact, the spot is not legal because it is adjacent to a fire hydrant. They may as well be pouring $115 down the drain . 'If a particular address had a huge number of tickets, I suspected that something might be amiss. And with some help from NYC Open Data, I launched my so called 'investigation.'' wrote Ben Wellington, a statistics professor at Pratt Institute, for Gizmodo. The fire plug is on Forsyth Street on New York's Lower East Side. 187 unsuspecting drivers have been caught in the last seven months alone. Mr has calculated that with the fine costing $115, it works out to $21,505. Blurred lines: The Lower East Side fireplug gushes out a flood of money for the city some $33,000 a year, according to one estimate by luring unwary drivers who think they¿re parking in a legal spot . The drivers blame two factors: white lines on the street look like the wide 'boxes' that are often used when parking is permitted. 'One theory is that technically, the lane behind the cars is not a protected bike lane. You would never know it by looking at it, but it is not painted and there are no markings. It is simply an empty space that people bike in. Should that matter? Probably not, but the NYPD might think otherwise. Unless this is a deliberate attempt to craft a 'honeypot,' there should be clearer markings on the pavement to avoid this seemingly arbitrary ticketing,' says Mr Wellington. A sidewalk extension that looks like a bike lane also creates added confusion for road users who may not realize that it is still prohibited to park in front of a hydrant, despite the large gaps and painted white lines. Prepare to be towed: The painted white lines make it appear as though it is totally legal to park here, but the proximity of a fire hydrant should give cause for concern . The space between the lines is easily wide enough for a car and marked with diagonal lines at some points - but not in front of the hydrant. Mr Wellington guesses that it is this particular hydrant that brings in the most money for the city out of all of the 110,000  fire-protection devices . The pictures from Google Street View show what appears to be a protected bike lane between between the cars and the hydrant. The curb extension was constructed in 2008 to widen the sidewalk. There is also a misconception that drivers think it is perfectly legal to park on the traffic-side line when a bike lane is between the sidewalk and the traffic lanes - even when a hydrant is on the sidewalk. The law states that in such cases there has to be a sign specifically permitting parking there. Mr Wellington has said the Department Of Transportation have confirmed to him that they will review the markings.",

On Friday UsWeekly reported Tom Cruise, 52, has a 'crush' on Emily, his 22-year-old assistant who's helping him while he shoots Mission: Impossible 5 around the world. In late September the actor was spotted with a mystery woman who appears to be the lady in question. They were side-by-side as he took a break from filming in London. Scroll down for video . A new romance?: Tom Cruise  is 'crushing' on a 22-year-old Mission: Impossible 5 female crew member, according to a Friday report from UsWeekly; in September the 52-year-old actor was spotted with this lovely woman on the London set of the sequel . She looks like a college student: The woman that Cruise was seen with in England wore a grey sweatshirt and a braided bracelet; interestingly, Tom had one on too . 'He's always flirting with her,' a source revealed. 'Most people on the film have noticed how into her he is.' Ever the professional, the father of three is waiting until his work on the big-budget action movie is over till he takes the lady out. 'He's already asked Emily to go out to dinner with him, on a date, when they're done shooting,' the source said. Mr On The Go: Cruise looked like he had his hands full with two cell phones and headphones on as the young lady greeted him; she too was wired up with a Walkie Talkie at the ready . Hot catch: The A lister has been single since divorcing Katie Holmes in 2012; together they have daughter Suri, aged eight . And the Oscar nominee is very excited about when that day comes. The insider has 'never seen him crush on anyone so hard.' Tom has two children with Nicole Kidman who are around the same age as the assistant: 19-year-old Connor (who is working as a DJ in nightclubs) and 21-year-old Isabella. The woman pictured with Cruise in September seems to be just his type: attractive with long hair and thick eyebrows. Not an easy film to make: The Oscar nominee has been doing many of his own stunts on the fifth installment of Mission: Impossible; here he was shooting a scene on an airplane on Monday in England . She could even pass for a relative of Holmes', who Cruise was married to from 2006 to 2012 and had daughter Suri, aged eight, with. Tom has not dated anyone since he split from Katie in the summer of 2012. But it was only last week that the Top Gun star was linked to both Miranda Kerr and Lindsay Lohan in separate reports. Both beauties denied they had romantic relations with the thrice-married A-lister (his first marriage was to 58-year-old actress Mimi Rogers). Another beauty on set: The Minority Report hit maker is also working with newcomer Stella Stocker on Mission: Impossible 5, which is due out in December 2015 . A flat-out hit: Tom in 1996 in the first Mission: Impossible movie, which has spawned three sequels . This new report comes from a source who is working on the set of the action film. Tom has been shooting M:I5 in England, Austria and Morocco. Mission: Impossible 5 is an action-spy film directed by Christopher McQuarrie, and written by Drew Pearce and Will Staples. It is the fifth film in the highly successful Mission: Impossible series. Will he marry for a fourth time?: The Edge Of Tomorrow superstar, seen here in May, is worth a fortune and still has a lot of power in Hollywood so the ladies must be flocking . Along with Tom as agent Ethan Hunt, Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton are also returning. Alec Baldwin is a fresh face in the cast. Newcomer Stella Stocker (who had a small part in Brad Pitt's Fury), also has a role. Interestingly, she resembles Katie as well. Filming began on M;I5 in August, 2014 and is scheduled to be released in North America by Paramount Pictures on December 25, 2015. They lasted six years: Cruise with Katie Holmes at the Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol premiere in NYC in December 2011 .

A design of rower that doubles up as a side table could mean the aerobics machine can be hidden in plain sight . Dubbed the ‘Ram and Rower’, the wooden device can be packed up into a table with wheels to help keep it hidden in plain sight. The rower seat is stored on top of the table, with the wheels hidden beneath. Separate wheels are also attached to the underside of the table so it can be moved into place. Once the seat is removed the table can be folded out, forming the body of the rowing machine. The seat can then be clicked into place, and a foam pad placed on top.

The Sports Direct tycoon has called an emergency shareholder meeting to vote on removing both Wallace and Nash from the board. The stock exchange statement read: 'The Company announces that Philip Nash has resigned from the Board of Rangers ('Board') with immediate effect. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley called an emergency meeting to vote Nash and Graham Wallace off the board . 'The Board would like to thank Mr Nash for his significant contribution to the Company during what has been a particularly challenging period.' Wallace had favoured striking a £16million rescue deal with former oldco director Dave King but found his efforts blocked by Sandy Easdale, the football board chairman who controls 26 per cent of the club's shares. In an earlier stock exchange statement, the Ibrox board vowed to defend Wallace and Nash against Ashley's bid to oust them but questions now hang over the chief executive's future .",

        "article": "Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen has not ruled out playing county cricket again next season. Pietersen who has been contracted to Surrey since 2010, although he only played in the T20 Blast competition last summer. The South African-born batsman said he would make a decision about his playing future over the next couple of months but insisted he had been in contact with Surrey, where his mentor Graham Ford is head coach. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Kevin Pietersen speak about bullying in the England camp . Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey during the Natwest T20 Blast semi-final against Birmingham Bears . 'I am definitely going to give it some thought over the next couple of months as to how I need to finish off my career because I look at the situation and think they are not going to pick me for the Ashes next year,' Pietersen said. 'I don't want to make quick decisions and I want to give it some time, give it some thought. 'I am in contact with Surrey because I love Surrey and Graham Ford, my mentor, is the coach there. I get on so well with Alec Stewart and the lads in the dressing room there. 'So if I decide that I want to continue playing and basically play for the next four or five years then, yes, it is something I am basically going to make happen in the next couple of months.' Former England head coach Andy Flower (right) was singled out for criticism in Pietersen's book . Since arriving in the UK from South Africa as a teenager, Pietersen has played county cricket for Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and now Surrey and amassed 104 Test appearances for England. Pietersen was speaking during a Q&A event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival with Sunday Times journalist David Walsh, who ghost wrote his controversial autobiography published last week. In the book Pietersen made several allegations, including claims of a bullying culture in the England dressing room. Former head coach Andy Flower and wicketkeeper Matt Prior were particuarly singled out for criticism. Following England's disastrous 5-0 whitewashing in the Ashes last winter in Australia, Flower stood down and Pietersen was told his Test career was over. Pietersen insisted that he would love to bat for England again and 'would do anything to go and play'. Andrew Strauss (right) fears Pietersen's book will hurt England in the long run . 'I would 100% commit everything I could to bat. I would do anything to go and play,' Pietersen said. 'The frustrating thing about this last summer is that England have now got a team where that bullying side looks like it has faded away and there are a lot of youngsters in that side that I got on really well with, who I helped out with their cricket. 'The sad thing is that I can be lying on the sofa the night before an international game and I can get a text message from players in the team asking me advice on how to play the opposition the next day. 'That makes me happy that they are asking me on how to play the next day when they should probably be going to their coach and also with sadness because I should still be in that team helping these guys bat and helping in team meetings and playing in games because that's where we could all benefit.' Pietersen also said that he would not have any problems playing under new head coach Peter Moores - who he likens in his book to a 'woodpecker tapping on our heads all day' during his first spell as England boss. Pietersen, in action for during the fourth Ashes Test in Melbourne last year, has spoken of his demons . 'When I did have my issues with Moores they were as a captain,' Pietersen told the Cheltenham audience. 'I said to the chairman of the ECB, I cannot captain with Moores, let me go back and bat. So I could easily go and bat, batting would not be an issue.' But he felt it was unlikely that he would ever be recalled by England while Giles Clarke remained chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). 'I said it before that I think the chairman might have to make way,' Pietersen said. 'Whether that happens I don't know. If it happens, it happens and said earlier that what will be, will be. I live in hope. Who knows what tomorrow brings? 'They might wake up tomorrow and decide enough's enough and this PR battle that is going on at the moment is not good for English cricket, I am certainly not proud of this PR battle but I've had to tell my side of the story.' One member of the audience asked Pietersen why England were such a successful team in recent years if Andy Flower was such a bad coach. 'We had some very, very good players who were at the peak of their careers and no matter who coached them we would have been successful,' the South African replied. Pietersen agreed with the comments last week of former England captain Andrew Strauss, who said the biggest loser in the wake of the publication of his book was the England team. 'I do agree with that and I don't like it and as I said I am not proud of it but what I am incredibly proud of is having the opportunity and the ability to sit down with David over the last few months and get my side of the story out,' Pietersen said. 'I've had too many times where my character has been assassinated with Flower being able to drive it one way, hammer me about injuries, nail me about this, go over me about that, and so I have just had my opportunity to come out and put my side of the story out and just leave it. 'It's a sad state where English cricket is but it doesn't have to be there now, it should have been sorted with a decent coach.' For nearly an hour-and-a-half Pietersen spoke about some of the demons that affected his playing career, such as knowing when he walked out to the crease whether he would get a good score or not. 'In the recent Ashes series we played in Australia I walked out to the wicket at Adelaide and I got out for nine. I walked down the wicket and hit Peter Siddle straight to mid-wicket and George Bailey caught me,' he said. 'I knew how I had got out and I knew I was lucky to get nine. But I got crucified - selfish, reckless, careless, why did you play the shot, why did you do this. 'I'm a 'feel' player and I'll know as soon as I get out to the wicket and touch my bat on the ground I know whether I am going to have a good day or a bad day. 'It's just the most ridiculous thing - the hours I put into training. I can walk out to the wicket and I can stand there and go 'Oh shit' - or walk out and think 'good luck you lot'. 'There are certainly those days that I feel horrendous. 'It has probably been my biggest struggle and I remember working a lot with the psychologists. If I walk out there and I am not feeling good how can I still get to 10? 'Because getting to 10 for me was everything because as soon as I got to double figures I knew I was home and away. Until I got there I knew it was only me who would get myself out. 'Good coaches and captains would understand, Duncan Fletcher and Michael Vaughan did. 'That day in Adelaide when I hit Siddle to mid-wicket why the hell was I trying to do that? It just doesn't make sense.' Pietersen said he was already planning for future after his career ends. 'I have been quite clever when I have been playing to set up quite a few businesses. The most exciting thing I have going at the moment is my cricket school in Dubai, which opens next month,' he said. 'My foundation is going to run alongside that. I love coaching kids and I love giving advice, encouraging... I love seeing people do well. I love coaching and I love giving back and I've set up this cricket school purely for that. 'If I get one or two of those guys that come through my academy end up being international players it would make me so proud.'",

        "article": "An 11-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan shot dead a rare albino deer with his crossbow while on a hunting trip with his father last Monday. While a child being able to hunt a deer may seem like a long shot, it's even more unlikely is that one could nab an elusive albino deer. Gavin Dingman shot the buck while being supervised by his father Mick Dingman on a hunting outing. Young hunter: Gavin Dingman shot the rare albino deer while being supervised by his father Mick Dingman . USA Today reports that just one in 20,000 deer are born albino. Some biologists claim that just one in 100,000 deer are albinos. 'He kind of feels like a rock star right now. Everyone is calling, all of the hunting shows and hunting magazines,' Mick Dingman told the Livingston Daily. This isn't the first time the Dingmans have spotted the albino deer either. They've seen the majestic white buck several times in the past couple of years and have taken photos of it. 'The whole neighborhood is familiar with it. Quite a few of the guys in the neighborhood were trying to get it,' Mick Dingman said. Gavin Dingman and his 13-year-old brother Graham take turns hunting with their father and on that one the Monday the deer was killed, it was Gavin's turn. Mick told reporters his son was 'nervous' at first when attempting to shoot the deer. 'My dad was just like, take a deep breath. Are you sure you can take the shot? If you're not 100 percent, we don't want to injure it,' “the boy told The Livingston Daily. Gavin was able to shoot the buck from 30 yards away. 'I double-lunged it,' he said. This isn't Gavin's first hunting victory. His prize: While 11-year-old Gavin being able to hunt a deer may seem like a long shot, it's even more unlikely is that one could nab an elusive albino deer . Last year he shot a deer 'straight through the heart.' While Mick is proud of his son, he's received some criticism from outsiders for letting his son take a shot at a deer. 'I've had people tell me, \"You should have taken the shot. You don't let an 11-year-old take a shot at a deer like that,” ‘he said. 'To me, in my opinion, it doesn't matter if it's a spike or a doe or a trophy deer. If you have confidence in them, it shouldn't matter what they are shooting at.' To memorialize Gavin's big moment, a taxidermist will stuff and create a full-body mount of the deer. 'It's too rare and too pretty not to spend the extra money and have the whole thing done,' Mick Dingman said. Gavin told The Livingston Daily that his friends and schoolmates are in awe of his accomplishment. 'They are like, wow, that is so cool,' he said. What is a trophy deer for Gavin would be a misdemeanor in other states, reports USA Today. Albino deer are illegal to kill in Illinois, Iowa, parts of Montana, Tennessee and Wisconsin. Michigan also prohibited killing them up until 2008. Other states don't have any restrictions based on the belief that albinos are inferior genetic stock. The albino deer have poor eyesight and are pale which make them more prone to being caught by other predators in the wild--and in civilization. Memorialized: A taxidermist will stuff and create a full-body mount of the deer to remember the big day .",

Authorities say 39-year-old William Lord Jr. was charged with aggravated assault and domestic violence assault on a child less than six-years-old, as well as domestic violence terrorizing. He was held in lieu of $5,000 cash bail following a court hearing Monday afternoon. Police say the child was unsecured in a car safety seat when the intoxicated Lord threw him down the stairs at about 3.30am Monday. Charged: William Lord Jr., 39, was charged with aggravated assault and domestic violence assault on a child less than six years old, as well as domestic violence terrorizing, for allegedly throwing his son down the stairs . The boy's mother took the child to the hospital where he was treated for skull fracture that is not considered life threatening. According to WLBZ2, Lord went to bed after his partner left the house. He was woken Tuesday morning by police, who called for him to come out of the house on a PA system. Lord came outside and was arrested. The child's mother, Ericka Melanson, 21, told police that Lord had recently been fired and was becoming increasingly difficult, according to The Portland Press Herald.

        "article": "Gary Cahill has seen off one of his former clubs with Chelsea this week and hopes the Premier League leaders can beat another on Saturday. Cahill, who joined Chelsea from Bolton in January 2012, helped the Blues to a 2-1 Capital One Cup win on Wednesday night to set up a fourth-round tie at Shrewsbury. Now the 28-year-old central defender, whose influence at Stamford Bridge is growing by the game, faces Aston Villa, the side where he began his career. Gary Cahill helped Chelsea beat Bolton in the Capital One Cup as the Blues ended up winning 2-1 . 'I had a great time at Villa, more than anything with the youth team,' Cahill said on chelseafc.com. 'I owe a lot to them, they brought me through and I had a great time, so I'm looking forward to it. 'They've had a great start to the season, apart from their last result, so it's going to be another tough test for us.' Villa are three points behind Chelsea in third place in the table after a 3-0 defeat at home to Arsenal followed their win at Liverpool in the previous game. Cahill wants to ensure Chelsea continue their unbeaten start to their Premier League campaign . Chelsea's win over Sky Bet Championship strugglers Bolton should have been more emphatic, but for some wasteful finishing, but Cahill was satisfied with a fifth win in an unbeaten seven matches at the start of the season. 'It's great to have a winning mentality,' he added. 'If you have a couple of sticky results it puts the pressure on going into games but at the moment we're unbeaten, we're going well and we should have confidence, especially playing in front of our own fans at Stamford Bridge.' Cahill was one of only two players retained from the starting line-up which drew 1-1 at Manchester City, alongside Cesar Azpilicueta, and enjoyed featuring against Wanderers. 'Any player will tell you that when you're playing against your old club there's that added bit of emotion,' he said. The England international moved from Bolton to Chelsea in 2012 and was re-united with his former team . 'You try not to let it affect you and play your normal game but I'm a professional and the most important thing is that we won the game. They made it tough for us but thankfully we won.' Kurt Zouma's debut goal was cancelled out by Matt Mills before Oscar netted what proved to be the winner on a night when victory should have been more convincing and Andre Schurrle, in particular, should have scored. Cahill added: 'Schurrle created a lot for himself, I thought he played well, cutting inside and firing shots at goal. 'People expect you to win the game and it's not that easy. There have already been a few shocks and thankfully we weren't one of them.'",

        "article": "Criminal connections: Michael Jones, 17, is accused of being an accessory to first degree murder in the Lane murder case but police knew him because his name kept coming up in other investigations . One of the three 'bored' teenagers held over the murder of Chris Lane in a drive-by shooting was linked to a string of armed robberies allegedly committed with his pregnant girlfriend, MailOnline can reveal today. Michael Jones, 17, who was driving the car and brought in by cops repeatedly after a spate of raids, one of the investigating detectives said today. MailOnline can also reveal that James Edwards, 15, who Jones allegedly said pulled the trigger, was known to have a 'very short' temper and is 'incredibly violent'. Detective John Byers told MailOnline that investigators recognized Jones' Ford Focus from surveillance footage and that triggered their search for the killers of the Australian baseball player. While investigating three different armed robberies in March of this year, Byers said that the police 'kept seeing his vehicle, we got to know his vehicle'. '(It was) the Ford Focus used in the drive-by shooting. The vehicle was known to us. That was one thing that helped identifying the vehicle used in the killing of Mr Lane,' he told MailOnline. 'I’ve not known him to be claiming any gang...I’ve been watching Michael Jones, in reference to some other crimes previously, in some armed robberies and with another gentlemen who’s been doing some second-degree burglaries.’ There were three armed robberies in Duncan within days of each other this past March, and that is when Jones’ face and car became familiar to investigators. ‘Whenever we executed a search warrant on a house where the armed robbers lived, he showed up when we were at the front door. They contacted him, because he showed up at a parking lot that was real close to the house, with his girlfriend— and she’s pregnant with his child,’ Detective Byers said. Connections: Jones (seen right next to an unknown young woman) and his pregnant girlfriend showed up at three searches relating to earlier armed robberies in the town and police began recognizing his car . ‘As we were compiling everything on the armed robberies and arresting those responsible, his name kept coming up. We pulled him in two maybe three times, interviewed him and his girlfriend too.’ The girlfriend has not been identified but she was in court briefly on Tuesday before the hearing for Jones, Edwards and Luna. She was sitting near Jones’ relatives and allegedly broke down in tears. She became so emotional that she left the room before Jones even entered. Police knew Jones had ties to the individuals involved in the armed robberies, and apparently so did Chancey Luna. One neighbor whose son was allegedly the group’s next target claims that Jones, Luna and James Edwards perpetrated the seemingly random killing as part of a gang initiation - possibly the Crips since the infamous group has a growing presence in the town - but police say it is slightly less formal. ‘The close association with all of these people, the armed robberies, and the ones that committed the murder, are all associated, they are known to be contacted by law enforcement,’ Detective Byers said. Suspects: Jones said that he was driving when either Chancey Luna (left) or James Edwards (right) pulled the trigger killing Chris Luna . Heartbroken: Sarah Harper (left) has spoken out about her devastation following her boyfriend Chris Lane's (right) murder during a drive by shooting on Friday when he was jogging near her house . ‘I cannot say this is a gang, no. They knew each other, they hung out. They committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but at this point I can’t say they are a gang. ‘The armed robbers are in jail, all three are in jail, I haven’t known them to be in gangs, they had their own group. These are closely associated, intertwined, between the armed robbery and the murder - known associates, with known contacts with law enforcement. Luna would be with this person at a traffic stop, and they were known to hang out together.’ Their full criminal histories have not been made public as they were treated as minors before the brutal killing. It also emerged today from court documents that security footage shows that after the shooting, the Ford Focus was parked behind a hotel for a little over ten minutes, and Edwards told investigators that the boys were smoking marijuana while they hid the murder weapon in the car's interior. Illegal: Edwards told officers that the group smoked marijuana behind a hotel after the shooting . The police report reveals that 17-year-old Jones admitted he was driving the car. ‘He stated to Lt Shoemake that Chancey Luna and James Edwards were in the car and that one of them had fired the gun and that he was not telling which had fired the gun but it was not him but it was either James Edwards or Chancey Luna,’ the report reads. An hour after their initial interview, Jones said that he wanted to speak to investigators again and he inquired whether his father or a lawyer had gotten in touch. When the police officer said that he could not tell him that information, the teen said that ‘he could not tell Lt Shoemake who had shot the male because if he did he would get killed’. The officer tried getting more information from Jones about the location of the gun - saying that he didn’t want it to get into the hands of a child - and Jones said that police would never find it because he gave it to someone else. ‘It is a .22 revolver and that is why you did not find any brass,’ Jones said. He would not reveal that person’s identity but said that individual had siblings in jail, which led police to believe that it was Odessa Barnes, a person whose name had come up during the armed robberies. Questionable ties: Detectives said that while there are pictures of Edwards (left) and Luna (right) throwing gang signs, they are not believed to be associated with any particular group, more like 'wannabes' Jones said that while they were smoking marijuana, he took out the cold air induction in his car and hid the gun there, presumably for the other individual to take it. While Jones did not seem to change his story dramatically during his police interviews, the new report shows that Edwards did tell two different versions of events - first saying that he wasn’t in the car at the time of the shooting and then saying that he knew who fired the shot but only because he was told who did and not because he saw. Tough image: Police also said that Edwards (pictured), who posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening, was a big fan of a rapper who promotes violence . That change of heart came after he met with his father in between two police interviews. It was also not his only unusual behavior inside the police department, as officers saw him dance while he was being checked into the facility. When Edwards was standing behind a desk, he ‘began to dance, he did some kind of dance motion,’ Detective Byers told MailOnline. Mwanwhile, a 25-year-old woman named Christina, who would not give her . last name for fear of retribution, said that she has known Edwards through her . cousin and he was 'always around' growing up. She said that he could be violent and would get in 'a lot of . fights'. 'A lot of it gang related. He would fight over nothing,' Christina said. 'Gangs are always an iffy thing around here, and when you . don’t exactly have family to look up to - then for someone like that the gang can . be the only family he has.' Edwards' father has been raising his son while his mother is . in jail for an unspecified crime. Christina told of a recent incident where she ran into . Edwards near an apartment complex and either Edwards or one of his friends was . waving a gun around. 'I told him to put it away, there are three or four children . around and that is not acceptable at all and he put it in his pants and walked . away,' she told MailOnline. Besides fighting, Christina said that she knew he 'has sold . marijuana in the past'. When asked if she was suprised by his alleged involvement in . Lane's murder, she said: 'Not so much that, but I didn’t think he was possible . of taking it that far.' Different instance: A friend told MailOnline how she recently saw Edwards put a gun in his pants after she scolded he and his friends for waving it around when there were children nearby (Edwards seen here in a picture from his Facebook account) Edwards, 15, and Luna, 16 face first degree murder charges and will be tried as an adult but if found guilty, they still may not receive the death penalty even though it is allowed in Oklahoma. Jones faces a lesser charge of accessory to first-degree murder and using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon. Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the thuggish beliefs of their idols, with Chief Keef the most popular among them. Today, Ford said: 'These boys were more into some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang stuff. One of the parents said something about rap. 'These boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and they said, \"there's the target\" and they followed him and shot him. He could have been anybody walking down the street.'",

        "article": "From grappling with a smartphone to using social media, for some people, technological advances can be a headache. But one man has embraced a lot of them and uses 700 systems at once to monitor his every move and mood. Chris Dancy, who is accepted to be ‘the most quantified human’ in the world, uses a range of sensors, devices, services and applications to gather real-time data about his body and the environment around him. Scroll down for video . Chris Dancy (pictured) is accepted to be 'the most quantified human' and uses sensors, devices, services and applications to give him real-time data about his body and the environment around him. The patches on his neck and wires coming out of his arms are not real and are intended to represent his 'connectivity' Chris Dancy, 45, uses a range of sensors, devices, services and applications to gather real-time data about his body and the environment around him. These include a Pebble smartwatch, Google Glass, a BodyMedia armband and Blue heart rate monitor. He collects data about what he eats, when he sleeps, how he uses his email, his health, travel plans and photos and even his dogs' levels of activity. Collecting data about his eating habits and fitness has enabled Mr Dancy to lose 100lbs (45kg) in weight. His home is also hooked up with gadgets, including a smart lighting system and a mattress cover that collects data in his sleep. He has been monitoring and collecting his personal data for five years, adding two or three systems every week. His connected lifestyle means he knows himself better than anyone and all this monitoring has even allowed him to lose 100lbs (45kg) by tracking how much he moves and eats. Mr Dancy, 45 from Denver, said: ‘When I touch something, I try to make sure it’s a something that I can get information out of so I can track, then search it, visualise it and share it with people who might want that piece of it. ‘I know now what to drink, what to eat, when to sleep and when to actually make myself get up. Very simple things like that. ‘It’s body and mind hacking. Just like we . hack computers and any type of data, your body and your mind is the . greatest information system humanity has ever known and understanding it . makes it hackable.’ Mr Dancy describes his lifestyle as 'body and mind hacking' and believes that the mind is greatest information system humanity has ever known and that understanding it makes it hackable. Here is a screenshot of his Google calender, which is a hub for readings from his various wearable devices and other collected data . Mr Dancy has a plethora of wearable technology on his person at all times, including a Pebble smartwatch and Google Glass to a BodyMedia armband and Blue heart rate monitor. His home is also hooked up with numerous sensors for products such as the smartphone-controlled Hue lighting system and a Beddit mattress cover, which collects data on his sleep. The dedicated technophile also tracks the progress of his two dogs by collecting data on their daily activities via pet GPS system, Tagg.

The dedicated technophile also tracks the progress of his two dogs (pictured) by collecting data on their daily activities via pet GPS system, Tagg . Explaining how he adopted his futuristic lifestyle, he said: ‘I realised I was putting a lot of information online and if one of these services went out of business, I would have been without a lot of information that was relevant, at least to me at that time. ‘It really started with me having a desire to digitally collect what I was creating. I just spent the last five years bringing on two to three systems a week.’ Mr Dancy collects and uses the data to his advantage and by tracking his eating and fitness habits he has seen a huge benefit to his health, including weight loss. Mr Dancy's data obsession started when he wanted to digitally collect what he was creating and in the last five years he has added a system a week. Here are some of the subjects he collects data on, including: health, work, content and money . Mr Dancy thinks that people don't understand the value of their information or they don't want to learn how to use it. Here is a graph showing his mood over a week . He is surprised that others have not followed him in collecting data to track their lives in the same way. ‘I have had a lot of people tell me they want to do it or they are working on it but it has been two-and-a half-years since people starting learning about me and no one has really done it. I don’t know what the hold up is as to me it is very easy to do. ‘Either they don’t understand the value of the information or it is just something hard for them to break,’ he said.

        "article": "A death mask made by Madame Tussaud has been used to recreate the likeness of Maximilien de Robespierre - the infamous revolutionary leader. Madame Tussaud, now known for her world-renown waxworks museum in London, went by her maiden name of Marie Grosholtz when she made the wax sculpture. During the French Revolution, she was saved from execution by agreeing to create death masks of famous people who met a grisly end by the guillotine. Reconstruction: Death mask made by Madame Tussaud was used to recreate of Maximilien de Robespierre . Phillipe Froesch, a facial reconstruction expert, has used Madame Tussaud's mask to recreate the face of the leader who started the Reign of Terror that cost tens of thousands of lives in 1793 and 1794. She took his head from the basket after he was decapitated on July 28, 1794 and the chambermaid's daughter sculpted the likeness. Madame Tussaud took the original sculpture with her when she went to London in 1802 and copies were made. One of these copies, in the Museum of Natural History in Aix-en-Provence, southern France, was used by Mr Froesch, the Times reports. He was asked to recreate Robespierre's face for a documentary about illness that affected famous men and women. Mapping: Mr Froesch used FBI techniques and it showed Robespierre had a pockmarked face . The facial reconstruction expert used a hand-held 3D scanner to map the scars, spots and fine details on the waxwork then set about recreating the face. Mr Froesch used FBI mapping techniques and the result showed Robespierre had an extremely pockmarked face and was 'pale and tired'. He said the result was a 'worrying face' and earlier portraits had made Robespierre look better than he was - probably out of fear. The expert is well-known in France after he recreated the face of King Henri IV using the 16th century skull and is now working on a project to bring the face of Rene Descartes back to life. Madame Tussaud learnt her skills from Dr Philippe Curtius and after she arrived in London set up and exhibition of her works in Baker Street. The collection has continuously grown over the last century and now includes celebrities, monarchy and historical figures.",

The Borussia Dortmund star scored his side's first goal in the 4-1 win at the Westfalenstadion, and celebrated by covering his mouth with his hand. For iPhone users who may have kept an eye on the 25-year-old's form in recent weeks, the celebration completed a trio of emoji references. Marco Reus does the 'speak no evil' monkey emoji celebration after scoring against Galatasaray . Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp looks pensive before his side's Champions League game against Galatasaray . The three popular symbols - a symbol of a monkey covering his eyes, ears and mouth - have been Reus' celebration for his last three goals. Reus covered his ears on Saturday for his goal against Bayern Munich, covered his eyes for the strike against St Pauli last week and completed the hat-trick on Tuesday. The symbols, a play on the phrase 'hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil' are among the most popular emojis used on the iPhone. 'Hear no evil'... the celebration the German performed against Bayern Munich at the weekend . Dortmund applaud their fans at the Westfalenstadion after their comprehensive 4-1 victory over Galatasaray . It remains to be seen whether Reus will continue the trend by emulating another emoji symbol, but despite it being all smiles in Europe, his side are struggling in the Bundesliga. They have qualified from their Champions League group with ease and should top the standings after Arsenal squandered a three-goal lead against Anderlecht. But domestically Jurgen Klopp's side are joint bottom with just two wins in 10 games. They face third-place Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday at the Westfalenstadion. 'See no evil'...

        "article": "Max Richmond was put into isolation for a day after he refused to wear a clip on tie . A schoolboy has been punished for refusing to wear a clip-on tie because he wants to wear a smarter traditional one - which breaches 'health and safety rules'. Max Richmond, 13, was put into isolation for a day, for wearing the proper tie at Colne Community School in Brightlingsea, Essex. The 1,438-pupil school insists pupils wear clip-on ties for health and safety reasons - but Max says the clip-on ones are uncomfortable and childish. He prefers to wear a traditional tie of exactly the same design, given to him by a neighbour. He was given work to complete on his own in a small cubicle for continuing to wear the tie. Max, of Waterside, Brightlingsea, said: 'It seems bizarre and unnecessary especially over something like the tie I was wearing. 'I like wearing a real tie because it feels proper. 'People have worn them for generations, and if you are not wearing one during secondary school then you are never going to learn the necessary skills for when you go into the world of work. 'When you are wearing a clip-on tie it is hard to be taken seriously, especially when you go to competitions against other schools - it feels foolish, and childish.' On their website in 2009, the Health and Safety Executive said it was a 'myth' that health and safety bans traditional school ties. The school has agreed to review the policy. Max says the clip-on ones are uncomfortable and childish. He prefers to wear a traditional tie of exactly the same design . Nardeep Sharma, headteacher, said the . rule was introduced about three years ago to support the health and . safety of young people . He said: 'This was in line with the practice in most secondary schools nationally. 'The policy can only be changed by governors and a parent has requested the governors review this policy, which the school has agreed to do.' Max said he welcomed the review and hoped the governors would take his points on board. Roger Bibbings, occupational safety adviser for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said schools can make pupils wear clip-on ties, but should not cite health and safety grounds. He said: .It might be a sensible precaution if a school insists on pupils wearing ties while handling rotating machinery, such as in a school workshop, but for any other reason you cannot say this policy was required under health and safety law.' The school said the rule was introduced about three years ago to support the health and safety of young people . The Health and Safety Executive's website says: 'Quite rightly, few parents would see wearing school ties as a safety issue. 'After all, millions of kids have been wearing ties for years without any real problems. 'Taking simple precautions during laboratory work or around machinery makes sense. But if the concern is about kids fighting, although clip-on ties may help, the real issue is discipline. 'So no, we don't ban school ties – it's down to the school to make decisions about uniform, not HSE.' A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive added: 'It seems to us to be a disproportionate response.' Linda Painter, of the Schoolwear Association, said that producers had reported a 'strong trend' in school opting for clip on ties, largely because every tie looks uniform and neat, but also because it means that the ties do not get wrapped around students' necks. She said: 'Lots of school do have clip on ties, it's a strong trend. It's not definitively about health and safety. 'Obviously they can come off quite easily and don't get stuck round children's necks, but clip-ons do mean that all the students' ties look the same and look smart.'",

A McDonald's customer suffered horrific burns after spilling a cup of tea that she claims the lid had not been fitted properly on. Joanna Audoire says as she sat down in her car with a tray containing the tea, the beverage toppled over covering her leg in boiling water. The 44-year-old mother-of-three is now considering suing the fast food restaurant after medics told her she would be scarred for life. Ms Audoire picked up a breakfast, a cup of tea, and a Coke from McDonald's to enjoy in her car after a shopping trip with a friend. She claimed that as she sat down the cup with the poorly fitted lid pitched over. When she removed her trousers she claims the skin on her left thigh peeled off too, leaving her with a huge bubbling L-shaped burn the size of her hand. The telemarketing worker was off work for more than a week because she couldn't walk properly due to the pain. Ms Audoire, from Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, said: 'I am seriously considering legal action for the time I have had to take off work and for the injury and trauma I have suffered. 'I was in immense pain. They need to take some responsibility for serving the tea as hot as that with a flimsy lid. 'When will they improve it? When a child is seriously burnt? It makes me cross. 'The lid couldn't have been on properly, and I know tea is hot, but was it too hot on this occasion? I think it was. It was very very painful. It shouldn't have happened.' Divorced Ms Audoire was shopping with a friend in Waltham Abbey, Essex, when they picked up food and drinks from the McDonald's nearby. She said she was sat in the passenger seat when she realised the Coke - which was in a cardboard holder with the tea - was about to topple, so she reached to grab it. Scroll down for video . Medics have told the mother-of-three that she could be scarred for life as a result of the injury . The McDonald's fast food restaurant in in Waltham Abbey, Essex . A spokesman for McDonald's said they had launched an investigation into Ms Audoire's (pictured left) claims  and were treating the incident 'seriously' The hot drink lid slid off and half a cup of tea covered her legs, she claims. 'I jumped out the car and was hopping around. At the time I had no idea the damage that had been caused,' she said. 'I got to work and I pulled my trousers down to go to the loo and it was horrible - the skin came off too. 'I got to the walk in centre and they treated it. They said it will probably scar.' Ms Audoire claims that the skin on her left thigh peeled off leaving her with a huge painful bubble . A few days later a nurse applied ointment and the skin has now started to bubble, leaving Ms Audoire with huge bubbles of puss covering her leg.' A spokesman for McDonald's said: 'We regret to hear that Ms Audoire sustained an injury following her visit to our restaurant. The safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees is our first priority and all of our restaurant crew are trained to serve hot drinks in a safe manner.' 'We are treating this incident very seriously and following Ms Audoire's recent contact with our Customer Services Department, we have launched a full investigation in to this matter. We continue to encourage an open dialogue with Ms Audoire regarding this matter.'",

        "article": "'Unacceptable': Chair of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge (pictured) said: 'Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child' Millions of pounds of British aid money could be lost to crooks and fraudsters because of 'unacceptably poor' controls on corruption, MPs warn today. The Commons public accounts committee warns the Department for International Development (Dfid) needs to impose 'much tougher' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector. MPs said they had heard evidence that millions of pounds was spent on projects with links to known fraudsters. They highlighted a £20 million investment in a power plant project in Ivory Coast, in which one company had alleged links to the notorious fraudster James Ibori, the former Wickes cashier who was jailed for 13 years in 2012 for a £50 million fraud. MPs also raised concerns about a £20 million investment in a gas plant in Nigeria, involving a company allegedly involved in 'looting Nigerian oil revenues'. The UK is the biggest donor to the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) - which was set up to invest in infrastructure projects in developing countries - with total support expected to reach £860 million by 2017. Today's report says the PIDG was beset by 'poor financial management', lavish travel spending, and doubts about the integrity of its investments. Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: 'It is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that Dfid is able to demonstrate that UK taxpayers' money is being used for its intended purpose - of helping the world's poorest people - and not ending up in the wrong hands. 'Every pound that is lost to fraud and corruption is a pound that could have been spent on educating a child, improving health systems or supporting economic development. 'We recognise that PIDG operates in countries where standards of governance can be challenging. However the department's oversight of PIDG has been unacceptably poor and has left it open to questions about the integrity of PIDG's investments and some of the companies with which it works.' A Dfid spokesman rejected the claims, saying there was 'absolutely no evidence' of wrongdoing linked to the companies involved in either the Ivory Coast or Nigeria projects. 'Britain's investment in the Private Infrastructure Development Group has helped to create 200,000 jobs and driven £6.8billion of private investment into some of the world's poorest countries, developing their economies and making them less dependent on aid,' the spokesman said. Investment: The Commons public accounts committee warns the Department for International Development (pictured, file photo) needs to impose 'much tougher' scrutiny of money channelled through the private sector . Warning: Committee chairman Margaret Hodge (pictured) said: 'It is essential for public confidence in spending on overseas aid that Dfid is able to demonstrate that UK taxpayers' money is being used for its intended purpose . 'We already have strong oversight of PIDG's activities and have recently clamped down on excessive travel rates. An independent review of their operations, backed by Britain, will ensure they continue to kick start growth in the developing world.' But critics said the report highlighted the folly of the Government's controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain's income on aid, which has been blamed for rushed spending. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Another day, another tale of international aid being handed out without proper checks or oversight. It is becoming a familiar story and shows how ludicrous it is to put an arbitrary 0.7 per cent target on the statute book. The department must improve its handling of taxpayers' money and ensure that not a penny sent abroad is wasted or lost in the system.' Labour last night said it had 'grave concerns' about the way money was being spent with the private sector. Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said: 'There's nothing wrong with working with the private sector. These are funds set up by a Labour government. My question is when you scale them up this quick without changes to governance and oversight (there is) concern about where and how the money is spent.'",

        "article": "Researchers have successfully carried out the first 'brain to brain' conversation online - with  participants who were 5,000 miles apart. The team transmitted signals over the internet directly from brain sensors. They were able to send the words 'hola' and 'ciao' from a location in India to a location in France. Researchers were able to send the words 'hola' and 'ciao' from a location in India (left) to a location in France (right) using internet-linked electroencephalogram (EEG) and robot-assisted and image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sensors. In the first-of-its-kind study, an international team of neuroscientists and robotics engineers have demonstrated the viability of direct brain-to-brain communication in humans. 'We wanted to find out if one could communicate directly between two people by reading out the brain activity from one person and injecting brain activity into the second person, and do so across great physical distances by leveraging existing communication pathways,' said Alvaro Pascual-Leone, of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. 'One such pathway is, of course, the internet, so our question became, could we develop an experiment that would bypass the talking or typing part of internet and establish direct brain-to-brain communication between subjects located far away from each other in India and France ?'' Recently published in Plos One the highly novel findings describe the successful transmission of information via the internet between the intact scalps of two human subjects – located 5,000 miles apart. Researchers using internet-linked electroencephalogram (EEG) and robot-assisted and image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technologies. Four healthy participants, aged 28 to 50, participated in the study. One of the four subjects was assigned to the brain-computer interface (BCI) branch and was the sender of the words; the other three were assigned to the computer-brain interface (CBI) branch of the experiments and received the messages and had to understand them. Using EEG, the research team first translated the greetings 'hola' and 'ciao' into binary code and then emailed the results from India to France. There a computer-brain interface transmitted the message to the receiver's brain through noninvasive brain stimulation. The subjects experienced this as phosphenes, flashes of light in their peripheral vision. The light appeared in numerical sequences that enabled the receiver to decode the information in the message, and while the subjects did not report feeling anything, they did correctly receive the greetings. 'By using advanced precision neuro-technologies including wireless EEG and robotized TMS, we were able to directly and noninvasively transmit a thought from one person to another, without them having to speak or write,' says Pascual-Leone. 'This in itself is a remarkable step in human communication, but being able to do so across a distance of thousands of miles is a critically important proof-of-principle for the development of brain-to-brain communications. We believe these experiments represent an important first step in exploring the feasibility of complementing or bypassing traditional language-based or motor-based communication.' Previous studies on EEG-based brain-computer interaction (BCI) have typically made use of communication between a human brain and computer. In these studies, electrodes attached to a person's scalp record electrical currents in the brain as a person realizes an action-thought, such as consciously thinking about moving the arm or leg. The computer then interprets that signal and translates it to a control output, such as a robot or wheelchair. The hotspot for brain communications: This image shows the area of the brain the researchers were targeting with to trigger phosphenes, flashes of light that appeared in subjects peripheral vision. But, in this new study, the research team added a second human brain on the other end of the system. Four healthy participants, aged 28 to 50, participated in the study. One of the four subjects was assigned to the brain-computer interface (BCI) branch and was the sender of the words; the other three were assigned to the computer-brain interface (CBI) branch of the experiments and received the messages and had to understand them. Using EEG, the research team first translated the greetings 'hola' and 'ciao' into binary code and then emailed the results from India to France. There a computer-brain interface transmitted the message to the receiver's brain through noninvasive brain stimulation. The subjects experienced this as phosphenes, flashes of light in their peripheral vision. The light appeared in numerical sequences that enabled the receiver to decode the information in the message, and while the subjects did not report feeling anything, they did correctly receive the greetings. A second similar experiment was conducted between individuals in Spain and France, with the end result a total error rate of just 15 percent, 11 percent on the decoding end and five percent on the initial coding side.",

        "article": "These spooky pictures which appear to show spirits hovering ominously over the heads of the living have gone on display for the first time in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast. They have been released just in time for Halloween by the Public Record Office Northern Ireland (PRONI) and all feature a Lieutenant Colonel E J Gordon Tucker after being found in his records. Taken shortly after the First World War the pictures were taken at a time when many people wanted to contact loved ones who had died in the conflict. Lieutenant Colonel E J Gordon Tucker and his companions are pictured after taking part in what is believed to have been a séance. They all seem unaware of the presence of a veiled woman leaning ominously over them . Lieutenant Colonel Tucker was a retired army officer who served in India and was a keen spiritualist . From the UK alone more than 700,000 men died during the Great War - and many families never had the chance to say goodbye. Spiritualism and communing with the dead experienced a massive surge in popularity - and had an unlikely champion. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, turned to spiritualism following the death of his son Kingsley in 1918. He sank into a deep depression and like many grieving parents he was desperate to speak with his son - something spiritualism offered. He became a vocal supporter of  spiritualism following the war and remained one for the rest of his life. Although the exact method used to create the images pictured is unknown, it is believed the ghostly apparitions were actually man-made using double exposure or by creating a 'spirit-like' mannequin. Catherine Millar, from the PRONI, said: 'Unfortunately we don't know how the spirits appeared. We will have to leave it to everyone's imagination. A ghostly apparition appears to engulf Lieutenant Colonel Tucker in this picture -  but he seems unperturbed . 'These images are in the context of a huge surge of interest in spiritualism after the First World War. Lieutenant Colonel Tucker was a retired army officer who served in India and a keen spiritualist. 'Lieutenant Tucker came from Oxford and it appears he had relatives in Ireland. The photographs appear to show Lt Col Tucker and companions and images of 'spirits' possibly after a séance. 'Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, devoted his life to spiritualism after the death of his brother and son during the Great War, although paradoxically Sherlock Holmes frowned upon such practices and solved crimes with the power of the mind.' Alan Robertson, from the PRONI, said: 'These photographs show 'spiritualist manifestations' surrounding people who were involved in a séance. 'They appear as 'faces' surrounded by white mist known as 'ectoplasm'. 'Many people had lost family members in the First World War without having the opportunity to say goodbye. 'During the 1920s and 1930s, some sought comfort by trying to contact their missing loved ones through their belief in spiritualism.'",

        "article": "Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has said qualifying for the Champions League again would be a bigger achievement than running Manchester City close to the Premier League title last season. And the Anfield boss, whose side face City at Anfield on Sunday two places outside the top four, claims the pressure is on Manchester United and Arsenal in the race to get among Europe's elite. Rodgers is on a 10-game unbeaten league run though Thursday's Europa Cup exit against Besiktas was costly because it closed one possible route to the Champions League and upset preparations with the players not returning to Merseyside until 4am on Friday morning. Brendan Rodgers says finishing in the top four this season would eclipse last year's achievements . Liverpool were knocked out of Europe in midweek, but have had a busier schedule this season . He believes the club's early-season woes are behind them – they were 10th as recently as December - and says the players deserve credit for overcoming the loss of Luis Suarez, a long-term injury to Daniel Sturridge, the impending departure of Steven Gerrard, the extra demands of European competition and the difficulty in assimilating eight new signings made over the summer. 'If we arrive in the top four this year, with everything we have been though, it will be a greater achievement than last year. Absolutely,' said Rodgers. 'It was certainly an incredible achievement to go so close last year but we only had to play one game a week. Making the top four this year would certainly be better. 'Our backs were against the wall, we weren't playing very well and when you don't win games you get criticism. No one likes it but you have to accept it. There is no doubt this season we have leareda lot and by the end of it I will be a better manager.' One of Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are set to miss out on Champions League football next season, a hammer blow to any of those huge clubs. Rodgers claimed: 'I think there is probably a big pressure on Manchester United and Arsenal from where they've been probably over the last 15 to 20 years. Last season, with Luis Suarez in the team, Rodgers' side finished second behind Manchester City . 'Manchester United is a club that has been synonymous with that and probably through to at least the quarter-finals of the competition. Arsene Wenger's record of getting them qualified has been outstanding. That is what you are up against. But I think it tells you the competition in this country. It's quite exciting really that you are fighting until the end.' Liverpool's famous 3-2 win against City last April put them top of the Premier League and seven poitns clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side, though they did have two games in hand. But a home defeat against Chelsea and draw at Crystal Palace cost them and they eventually fell two points short. Rodgers insists he has been too busy to dwell on it this season but acknowledges it is something he could look back on in years to come. Of more immediate importance is trying to get Liverpool back into the Champions League after this season's disappointment that saw them exit at the group stage. 'That is the priority,' says the manager. Liverpool's reputation worldwide is second only to Manchester United largely due to their success in the 1970s and 80s but with Chelsea and Manchester City growing their fan bases, owner John W Henry needs to keep the club among the elite to protect his brand. Rodgers talks to his team before the penalty exit against Besiktas on Thursday night in Istanbul . Liverpool take on champions City on Sunday hoping to keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester United . United had to pay over the odds for the likes of Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera to compensate for missing out on the Champions League. Liverpool haven't got similar cash to burn on transfer fees or wages – they only escaped FPP punishment last week because they successfully argued part of their spending was for an expansion of their stadium. 'We are about developing and creating world-class talent. Liverpool is still talked about as a worldwide club, which is important,' he said. Jordan Henderson is likely to return to the team for the crucial Premier League clash against Manchester City . Mario Balotelli, replaced by Rodgers on Thursday, is in the squad to face his former side on Sunday . 'I think the top four looked a long way off from where we were but we always believed that once we could work together and have more working time together, we could challenge. Again it is the elite competition, the Champions League, it is where the best players and managers want to work and we put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity to do that.' Jordan Henderson and Lazar Markovic are expected to return from the side that lost on penalties to Besiktas though Gerrard is still out with a hamstring problem. There could be a place in the 18-man squad for Mario Balotelli who helped City win the league in 2012.",

        "article": "Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has set his sights on Champions League glory this season as the Turin club looks to regain its place at European football's high table. Pirlo has been central to his team's push for a fourth successive Serie A title this term, but the 35-year-old playmaker knows that it is on the continent that Juve must impress to be considered a force again, against the backdrop of Italian football's waning reputation. Indeed, with many Italian clubs' star players moving abroad, the division is not as respected as it once was. Juve last won the Champions League in 1996 and last reached the final in 2003, but were eliminated from last year's competition at the group stage. Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo is targeting Champions League glory with the club this season . With Serie A's reputation waning, Juventus will do well to keep hold of star talents such as Paul Pogba . Juve striker Carlos Tevez is attracting interest from abroad and will need an incentive to stay in Turin . Now, as Paul Pogba and Carlos Tevez are attracting interest from foreign suitors, Pirlo feels that stepping up in the Champions League is the only way for Juve to be considered a powerful force once again and retain their best assets. Speaking to La Stampa newspaper ahead of his team's tie with Borussia Dortmund in the competition's last 16, he said, 'I came to Juve in order to win. I am very happy but now we must make the next step up the ladder.' 'I'd like to win another Champions League before retiring,' added Pirlo who won two Champions League titles with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007. Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri meanwhile, recognised Pirlo's unwavering quality despite the midfielder's age. 'He gives the team great shape and, above all, is a point of reference when the team is under pressure,' he said. 'Andrea has two magic feet. When he strikes with his right foot he gives the ball an incredible flight.' Juve manager Massimiliano Allegri answers questions in his press conference ahead of Tuesday's game . Although he is 35-years-old, Pirlo (right) is still playing at the top of his game for Juventus . Pirlo (left) celebrates with Juventus goalscorer Fernando Llorente (right) during the 2-1 win over Atalanta . Tuesday's match in Turin is the first meeting between Juve and Dortmund since the 1997 Champions League final, which the Germans won 3-1. Although Dortmund have struggled in the Bundesliga this season, their European form has provided a stark contrast, with Jurgen Klopp's men storming through the group stage with successive wins in their opening four games. And Pirlo gave assurances that Juve would not be underestimating the quality of their opposition. 'We will not fall into the trap of confusing Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga status with their real quality,' he said.

        "article": "Painter Vincent van Gogh may have been murdered, according to a gunshot wounds expert who has analysed vital forensic evidence . Painter Vincent van Gogh may have been murdered, a leading forensics expert has claimed. The long-held theory that the troubled artist shot himself in a wheat field near Paris in 1890 may have to be reconsidered after the shocking claim. Dr Vincent Di Maio, an expert on gunshot wounds, reassessed vital evidence from van Gogh's shooting and believes the painter could not have shot himself in the chest. Dr Di Maio, a key witness in the trial of George Zimmerman - the man who was accused of shooting US teenager Trayvon Martin, used evidence and testimony from the time to come to his conclusion. According to Vanity Fair, the forensics expert told Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith - who have long believed that van Gogh did not commit suicide - that the painter's fatal wounds did not look as if they were self-inflicted. According to the son of van Gogh's physician Paul Gachet Sr, Paul Jr, the wound had a 'brown and purple halo around [it]'. Previously historians thought that the purple area was caused by the proximity of the gun to van Gogh's chest and that the brown colouring was caused by gunpowder burns. Speaking of the 'purple halo', Dr Di Maio said: 'In fact, this is subcutaneous bleeding from vessels cut by the bullet and is usually seen in individuals who live awhile. Its presence or absence means nothing.' He added that the brown ring was simply 'an abrasion ring and seen around virtually all entrance wounds. It just indicates an entrance'. Dr Di Maio also called into question how van Gogh would have been able to shoot himself in the left side of his chest with the revolver he is alleged to have used. 'It would be extremely difficult to shoot oneself in this location [i.e., on the left side] with the left hand. The easiest way would involve putting one’s fingers around the back of the grip and using the thumb to fire the gun,' he said. Vincent van Gogh, who painted The Starry Night a year before his death, was thought to have committed suicide . The troubled painter was believed to have shot himself with a revolver in a field outside Paris - until now (pictured: The Fields, by van Gogh) 'Using one’s right hand is even more absurd. You would have to put the right arm across the chest and again place one’s fingers on the back of the grip and use the thumb to fire the gun.' The forensics expert added that the painter would have had scorch marks on his hand if he had shot himself at such close range, which no testimony from the time suggests was the case. Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith previously claimed in a biography of the painter that he did not kill himself . Dr Di Maio's final conclusion read: 'It is my opinion that, in all medical probability, the wound incurred by Van Gogh was not self-inflicted. In other words, he did not shoot himself.' Mystery remains over who, if not himself, van Gogh's shooter was. It took 29 agonising hours for the artist to die, just days after he had ordered more paints - suggesting he had no intention on taking his own life. Police are believed to have investigated the shooting briefly but no records remain of what they found. Whispers around the village of Auvers-sur-Oise, where van Gogh lived and died, at the time of the painter's death suggested that he was killed by 'young boys'. In the 1930s, Scholar John Rewald travelled to Auvers to ask residents who lived in the village at the time of the death what they knew. Some said van Gogh was shot accidentally by a group of boys and that the painter chose to protect their identity by saying he had tried to commit suicide. Mr Naifeh and Mr White Smith put their theory to a curator at the Van Gogh Museum, in Amsterdam, who told them: 'I think it would be like Vincent to protect the boys and take the \"accident\" as an unexpected way out of his burdened life. 'But I think the biggest problem you’ll find after publishing your theory is that the suicide is more or less printed in the brains of past and present generations and has become a sort of self-evident truth. 'Vincent’s suicide has become the grand finale of the story of the martyr for art, it’s his crown of thorns.'",

        "article": "Your Facebook posts are typically seen by three times as many people as you think they are, claims a new study. Researchers at Stanford University found that users of the social media platform drastically underestimate the number of people looking at their content based on factors including how often their friends post, plus how many likes, comments and shares they receive. ‘Posting to a social network site is like speaking to an audience from behind a curtain. The audience remains invisible to the user: while the invitation list is known, the final attendance is not,’ writes Stanford assistant professor Michael S. Bernstein in the study. Researchers at Stanford University found that Facebook users drastically underestimate the number of people looking at their content . New research has found that people's Facebook posts are typically seen by three times as many people as they think they are . ‘Feedback such as comments and likes is the only glimpse that users get of their audience.’ While Facebook does have access to data about how many people look at each post, it only shares this information with advertisers and not with ordinary users. The research suggests that is a situation that Facebook wants to maintain because users would post differently if they had a proper breakdown of who was viewing their content. The researchers found that what users post is based on the reactions that they have received to what they’ve posted in the past. Users with the same number of friends have highly variable audience sizes . If people knew that their posts were having much less impact on their audience they might choose to post less frequently which would be a disaster for Facebook which like all successful social media platforms depends on user interaction. The research, carried out in tandem with Facebook’s data science team, looked at 220,000 users over the course of a month. They found that Facebook users reached 35 per cent of their friends with each post and 61 per cent of their friends over the course of a month. The number of unique friend leaving likes is positively associated with audience size, but has a large variance . The researchers suggest that users are also happy to underestimate the size of their audience because if a post receives little or no comments it is more comforting to believe that few people saw it rather than accept that many people saw it but few liked it. ‘I think this is something we need to better understand,’ Bernstein told Buzzfeed, arguing that fear of rejection is just one of many possible reasons Facebook users underestimate their audience. ‘When I post content, do people not react to it but enjoy it? Do they not react to it and it is grating on them over time and they choose to unsubscribe? We don’t know.’ The researchers are keen to carry out more in-depth analysis of social media and how people react with it.",

        "article": "Boko Haram militants are reported to have  kidnapped 185 women and children, after slaughtering 32 people in an attack on a remote village in northeast Nigeria. Two officials, who requested anonymity, said the group gathered the women and children together and took them away in trucks after burning most of the village with petrol bombs . 'After killing our youths, the insurgents have taken away our wives and daughters,' said Mukhtar Buba, who fled Gumsuri to the Borno state capital Maiduguri. Scroll down for video . An image grab made on October 31, 2014 from a video obtained by AFP shows the leader of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram Abubakar Shekau (Center) delivering a speech . Details took four days to emerge because the mobile phone network has largely collapsed in the area roughly 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Maiduguri, and many of the roads are impassable. Gumsuri is located on the road that leads to Chibok, where Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls from a school in April. One of the local officials said the village had previously been protected against Boko Haram violence by a strong vigilante force, but that they were overpowered in Sunday's attack. 'For the past one year, the insurgents have made several attempts to attack Gumsuri but were resisted by the gallant youths of the village,' he told AFP. 'It is sad that on Sunday, the village was subdued,' he added. Militant Islamists Boko Haram abducted more than 200 girls  in April from a school in Chibok, which - like Gasmuri - is located in the northeast of Nigeria . The military and police were not immediately available for comment. Boko Haram has repeatedly attacked the vigilante forces which have formed across the northeast, describing them as legitimate targets for siding with Nigeria's military. Nigeria on Wednesday sentenced 54 soldiers to death for mutiny, assault, cowardice and refusing to fight Islamic extremists. The court-martial charges all were connected to the soldiers' refusal to deploy to recapture three towns seized by  Boko Haram in August, according to the charge sheet. The lawyer for the condemned men, Femi Falana, said the 54 soldiers were convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad. He said five soldiers were acquitted. They all were accused of 'conspiring to commit mutiny against the authorities of 7 Division, Nigerian Army,' which is on the front line of the fighting in the northeast of the West African nation. Twelve soldiers were sentenced to death in September for mutiny and attempted murder of the commanding officer in the counter-insurgency. They blamed him for the deaths of an unknown number of soldiers ambushed and killed after they were ordered to drive at night on a road frequently attacked by the militants. Troops regularly complain that they are outgunned by Boko Haram, they are not paid in full and they are abandoned on the battlefield without enough ammunition or food. The other local official said the insurgents 'stormed the village in a convoy of vehicles (armed) with petrol bombs' and heavy weapons. Buba, the resident, said more than half the village had been destroyed. 'The terrorists mercilessly attacked us and killed at will,' he told AFP. Borno is the epicentre of Boko Haram's five-year uprising aimed at creating a strict Islamic state in northern Nigeria. Thousands of people have been killed in the five-year Islamic uprising that has driven some 1.3 million people from their homes, with tens of thousands fleeing across borders into Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Boko Haram has seized a string of towns and villages and in August declared an Islamic caliphate along Nigeria's border with Cameroon. In recent weeks, Special Forces have been deployed and have recaptured at least four towns with help from air raids, traditional hunters and vigilantes. The turnaround comes as Nigerians prepare for Feb. 14 presidential elections that are expected to be the most closely contested since decades of military dictatorship ended in 1999. President Goodluck Jonathan, 57, is being challenged by former military dictator Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, 72. Buhari is being touted by an opposition coalition as more likely to succeed in curbing the insurgency and in fighting corruption that Jonathan is accused of fueling. Attacks similar to Sunday's violence in Gumsuri have escalated over the last 18 months, with the insurgents taking control of more than two dozen towns and villages in the region. Kidnappings have also increased, part of a campaign by Boko Haram to boost its supply of child fighters, porters and young women who have reportedly been used as sex slaves. The military has offered repeated assurances that the uprising will soon be contained, but so far there have been few signs of progress. Gumsuri is located in the northeast of Nigeria, roughly 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Maiduguri . Nigerian soldiers, handcuffed in pairs, leave the court premises after the opening of the General court-martial in Abuja.

Sylvia Lancaster, who founded the Sophie Lancaster Foundation in her daughter’s memory, was honoured by the Prince of Wales earlier today for her work in stamping out hate crimes. 'He talked about Sophie, actually, and about gang culture,' a delighted Mrs Lancaster said after the ceremony. Proud: Sylvia Lancaster, mother of murdered Sophie, shows off her OBE following the investiture ceremony . Tragic: Sophie Lancaster was just 20 when she was beaten to death by a gang of teenagers . 'I’m sure she would be proud. To be here, and we can talk about it, can’t we? - You’re here in Buckingham Palace - it’s very special ... 'It’s not just about the work that we do, it’s a validation of the work that we do and of the alternative subcultures as well.' Mrs Lancaster said she was touched that Prince Charles knew about her 20-year-old daughter's tragic death in 2007. Miss Lancaster was with her boyfriend Rob Maltby, 21, when she was set upon by drunk teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashire. The gang turned on her and Mr Maltby, who survived the attack, because of their alternative appearance. Horrifically, Miss Lancaster was kicked and stamped on while she knelt on the ground, cradling the injured Mr Maltby. Both fell into comas but Miss Lancaster, a gap-year student, never regained consciousness and died in hospital 13 days later. Goths are not often seen at Buckingham Palace, but Mrs Lancaster wanted to add a touch of her late daughter’s style for her audience with the Prince. 'I’ve got a velvet bag with a skull on it and that’s because it represents the subcultures, and I wanted to bring them with me,' said Mrs Lancaster, who also sported black and silver nail polish. 'That’s my thing. And my funky nails. When I was younger I was always quite different, but I really never had the balls to dress like that. But I like the touches.' Heartbreaking: Although Sophie died, her boyfriend Rob Maltby, 21, did survive the appalling attack . Sympathetic: Prince Charles, pictured at an earlier event with Camilla, passed on his sympathies . Proud: Others to be honoured by Prince Charles included Andrea Fox MBE and Dr Rosemary Butcher MBE . Delighted: Newly minted CBE Sunita Mason holds up her award following the investiture ceremony . She said she hoped her charity, which aims to challenge prejudices towards people from alternative subcultures and campaigns on hate crime legislation, would offer troubled youngsters hope. 'We got a letter, probably last week, from a dad whose daughter was being bullied in school - the kids had even given her razor blades,' Mrs Lancaster said. 'Her dad was saying \"Thankfully there’s someone we can talk to, and you have made it easier\" - that there is somebody who’ll listen.' Mrs Lancaster also revealed that she has stayed in touch with Mr Maltby, who has spent the years since the attack rebuilding his life. 'Rob should be allowed to get on with his own life,' she said. 'Thankfully he is doing that.'",

        "article": "This is the shocking moment balaclava-wearing protesters used iron bars to beat a huntsmaster unconscious during a meet. Mike Lane, Joint Master of the Tedworth Hunt in Wiltshire, had been attempting to calm saboteurs when he was punched, kicked, spat on and left needing hospital treatment. The attack happened  after a fractious day of confrontations during a drag hunt on Saturday, when the masked group followed the hunt from the kennels in the morning. Scroll down for video . A protester wearing camouflage trousers and a balaclava attacks one of the huntsmen with what has been described as 'iron bars on a rope' The masked group are seen swinging iron bars as the man jumps back in defence before he is knocked out . Mike Lane can be seen lying on the floor (right) after he slipped over and while on the ground was kicked in the head twice and knocked out . The 39-year-old explained that he had become upset after they were spraying the dogs with citronella spray - a harmless solution used to train nuisance dogs. He said: 'We were packing up just after 4pm and it got quite violent. Five or six of them came across to where we were all parked and started to make a nuisance of themselves. 'I went over to try to calm it all down and one of them spat in my face. I was then punched by another and a scuffle broke out. 'I slipped over and on the ground one of them kicked me in the head twice and knocked me out.' He added that after that, he has no recollection of what happened, but recalls 'iron bars being swung on lengths of rope'. 'Luckily there were still enough people around who came to my aid and they ran back to their vehicles and drove off at speed. Mr Lane said the group had been 'harassing' them throughout the drag hunt and were 'spraying the hounds with citronella spray' and he had remonstrated with them when the scuffle broke out . He was taken to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon and  treated for concussion and several broken teeth . 'Lots of people videoed what happened, and it is quite disconcerting to see yourself being knocked out on film.' Police have now launched a major investigating into the incident, which happened near the village of Everleigh in Wiltshire as the meet closed, and are trying to identify those responsible. Mr Lane was taken to the Great Western Hospital in Swindon where he was treated for concussion and several broken teeth. A spokeswoman for Wiltshire Police said: 'The Tedworth Hunt had been out on a drag hunt and according to the hunt, a group of up to a dozen people - both men and women - wearing balaclavas had been harassing the hunt throughout the day. 'The protesters had left the scene by the time police arrived. 'We can confirm that a 39-year-old man from the Marlborough area who is involved with the hunt was assaulted and needed treatment at Great Western Hospital. Mike Lane, 39, is the Joint Master of the Tedworth Hunt and sustained injuries that left him needing hospital treatment following the attack in Everleigh, Wiltshire, on Saturday . 'The man was knocked to the ground and received injuries to the head and back and was briefly unconscious. Police officers gave him first aid until an ambulance arrived. 'We are gathering evidence from witnesses, including video and still images recorded by Tedworth Hunt supporters.' Police said they are treating the case as a serious incident of ABH and potential public disorder. Inspector Paul Longden, of Wiltshire Police, said: 'Whilst we have no issue with people lawfully protesting, this was a totally unacceptable assault involving a group of men and women wearing balaclavas. 'We are making every effort to find and bring to justice the people who inflicted these injuries.' The incident is the latest in a long line of violent confrontations between hunt saboteurs and hunts, with both sides claiming the other to be the more violent. Tim Bonner, campaign director for the Countryside Alliance, said the incident showed that saboteurs needed to 'unmask'. The hunt saboteurs were captured on camera by hunt members but are almost completely covered up . The police has described the attack as 'totally unacceptable' and has launched an investigation to try and identify those responsible . 'This was a particularly nasty and cowardly attack by people who hoped by wearing face coverings they would avoid prosecution,' he said. 'The number of people involved in saboteur activities is far fewer than in the past, however we are concerned that the extremists who remain are increasingly resorting to violence. 'There have been a number of incidents over the past few years involving assaults on hunt staff and supporters by people who have masked their identities. 'We are particularly worried about the increasing tendency to violence by those wearing balaclavas and face coverings in a bid to escape the law.

        "article": "Arrest: Verna McClain has been charged with capital murder in the killing of 28-year-old Kala Marie Golden, after she shot her and stole her baby . A mother was shot dead by a nurse who kidnapped her newborn baby. Kayla Golden, 28, was blasted seven times with a handgun when Verna McClain reportedly pulled up alongside her in a car. Despite her injuries she tried to stop McClain snatching three day-old Keegan but was knocked to the ground and later died. Police eventually traced McClain – who had reportedly targeted Miss Golden at random – to a home near Houston, Texas. Keegan was found safe and well. According to U.S. reports, McClain – a mother of three – had in recent weeks told her family she was adopting a child. After allegedly killing Miss Golden she told her sister Corina Jackson she now had a fourth child in her family. McClain is now facing a capital murder charge which means she could be given the death penalty if convicted. The horror began when Miss Golden took Keegan to her local paediatrician in Houston for a routine check-up on Tuesday afternoon. McClain and an unidentified male passenger are said to have pulled up alongside Miss Golden’s pick-up truck in their blue Lexus before she opened fire. Plan: McClain (pictured right with her sister Corina) had told her sister she was about to adopt a baby . Taken: Keegan Schchardt (left) was snatched after his mother Kayla Golden, 28, (right) was fatally shot . Witnesses described the sound as being like ‘pop pop pop’ and that even after being shot blood-stained Miss Golden managed to try to grab her baby back. Lieutenant Dan Norris of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said: ‘The child was being put into the suspect vehicle and that’s when the mother tried to get into the car. ‘The car sped away, knocking the lady to the ground.’ The Lexus was traced to McClain’s sister’s house in Houston and when a SWAT team burst in they found Keegan. From there investigators were able to find McClain herself in another home just outside the city. According to a police affidavit obtained by ABC News, McClain has admitted to the shooting and told her sister that she did it because she wanted to ‘adopt’ another child. Search: Officers enter an apartment where they found a woman speaking to the suspect on the phone . Closing in: Officers had tracked the blue Lexus used as a getaway car back to the apartment . Officers take cover behind a car at the apartment complex while SWAT team members broke down the door . She already has three children aged six, ten and 16. The killing comes only a day after Keegan’s father Keith Schuchardt posted pictures on his Facebook page announcing the baby’s birth. He wrote: ‘Baby keegan is here. born 4/14/12 6 lbs 15 oz, 20 inches long. Looks like me lol.’ According to U.S .reports he has not even signed the child’s birth certificate yet. Keegan is currently in the care of social services and his family are waiting for a full background check on them to be finished before they can have the child back. Support: The baby's father, Keith Schuchardt, is comforted by friends and family outside his home . Grief: Mr Schuchardt said how much he loved Golden and how they'd been excited about their future . The baby’s grandmother Linda Golden said she rushed to the scene but was not there in time to say goodbye to her daughter. She said: ‘I wanted to kiss her before they put her in the ambulance. She died trying to save her baby.’ Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said Miss Golden was in the wrong place at the wrong time and that McClain just wanted any child to add to  her family. He said: ‘There were statements as indicated in the arrest record that were made by Miss McClain that led us to believe that, in fact, this was an intentional act on her part. Caught: McClain (pictured right with her sister Yoki) has three children and is a registered nurse . Proud: Golden with Mr Schuchardt, who had announced the birth of their son on Facebook on Saturday . ‘Not that Miss Golden was targeted specifically, but that this was part of a plan to kidnap a child.’ McClain’s alleged male accomplice was also arrested but had not been charged last night.

Initial scans indicated that he would be out of action for up to six months after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury in Stoke's 4-1 victory at Rochdale in the FA Cup. However, Sportsmail understands that subsequent tests have demonstrated that although the anterior cruciate ligament suffered damage, the meniscus and the two lateral ligaments have not been adversely affected. Bojan Krkic receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the Rochdale goal . Stoke forward Bojan is tended to by the club physio after injuring his knee against Rochdale . It is now understood that Krkic will be able to return to training in May and he is hoping to be in prime condition on the first day of pre-season. He will still miss the remainder of this campaign but fears that he may also be absent for the beginning of next season have been eased. He will now miss only three months of competitive action. The forward, who had been in outstanding form before suffering the injury, now requires a more minor operation than had been initially feared.

        "article": "A city's independent traders are launching their own currency to boost local businesses and prevent it becoming another victim of 'Clone Town Britain'. Organisers hope the Bristol pound will stop big companies and bankers swallowing up cash that is desperately needed by hard pressed local firms. Over 100 business have already signed up to accept the new currency, which goes into circulation in May, including a family bakery, local theatre, dozens of small cafes and Somerset brewed Thatcher's Cider. The currency has been launched in Bristol to help the local economy and prevent big companies 'hoovering up' cash from local trade . Notes will printed in £1, £5, £10 and £20 denominations, with one Bristol Pound worth exactly £1 sterling. Consumers can open an account with the Bristol Credit Union, which is administering the scheme. This money can then either be cashed for the notes or used electronically to pay bills online or even with a mobile phone. The currency has the backing of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and will have the same protection as any other deposit account. Ciaran Mundy, the director of the Bristol Pound, said the scheme hoped to keep cash in the city. He said: 'This will be money created by the people of Bristol for the Bristol people. 'Big companies just hoover up money from a local area. 'Massive shops with massive marketing and advertising budgets can easily wipe out local businesses. 'Money goes into their financial system and typically out into London and into the offshore sector. 'We'll be driving to get more money going to independent traders, to ensure we continue to keep the diversity of our city. Keeping it local: The Bristol pound will be available in several denominations and will help retain the 'diversity of the city' 'One of the reasons people love living here is because it's got a massive number of diverse, independent traders. 'Sometimes we don't realise what we've got until it's gone. 'The whole town clone town Britain hasn't yet happened in Bristol yet, but there have been a lot of independent firms that have struggled. 'We have seen the shutters go up in and around Bristol. 'We also hope that visitors to the city will change a bit of money while they are here. 'It's a serious goal, but it will also be a bit of a novelty and fun for tourists.' The organisers are holding  a competition to help design the new notes, although they have already created a logo, and produced security features to counter forgery. There is a silver hologram design, a gold foil strip with serial numbers embedded and other features which are impossible to reproduce. Barbara Janke (corr), leader of Bristol City Council, said: 'This is a chance to demonstrate the economic resilience of the city. 'We want to make it as easy as possible for people to use the Bristol Pound.' The Totnes Pound was the first to launch, in Devon in 2006 and has 70 traders involved. Eighteen months ago Stroud, in Gloucestershire, starting printing its own currency, but to date no more than 30 firms are taking the money.",

        "article": "Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock believes Hull's Steve Bruce deserved to win last season's manager of the year ahead of his Eagles predecessor Tony Pulis. After winning promotion from the Championship, Bruce steered Hull to a 16th-placed finish in the top flight and led the club to its first ever FA Cup final. He was beaten to the top manager's prize, however, by Pulis, who rescued Palace from the bottom three and guided the Eagles to 11th. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a snippet of Neil Warnock's pre-match press conference . Steve Bruce should have won manager of the year last season ahead of Tony Pulis according to Neil Warnock . Neil Warnock celebrates Wilfried Zaha's last-gasp equaliser to earn Crystal Palace a point at Newcastle in his first game back in charge of the south London side in August . Palace travel to Hull on Saturday and Warnock believes his opposite number should have been given more recognition for his success last term. 'I know Tony got manager of the year but I thought Steve Bruce was head and shoulders the best manager around,' Warnock said. 'To make a club like Hull very comfortable in the Premier League and to get to the FA Cup final - I thought that was fantastic. 'He's done an incredible job and he's got fabulous support from his chairman too. 'I know the chairman gets criticism but there aren't many teams in the bottom half who have had as much money put in as Hull. 'He's been fantastic and they've bought some very good players.' Warnock arrived at Selhurst Park at the end of August and Palace are unbeaten in the league since he took over. An impressive 3-2 victory at Everton was followed by a 2-0 win at home to Leicester last weekend, which sees the Eagles sitting ninth in the table. 'I've got nothing to lose and I want my players to enjoy it and not be frightened of expressing themselves in the right areas,' Warnock said. Steve Bruce and Tony Pulis embrace during Hull's clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park last season . 'Everyone has got strengths - I'm very lucky because you couldn't ask for more effort and commitment. 'As a Palace fan that's the minimum you require - you want your players to sweat blood and that's what they're doing. 'The fans get behind the players because they know they're trying their hardest. 'It was a difficult start to the season but since then we've worked very hard and we're getting the rewards.' Warnock allowed 20-year-old Jonny Williams to join Ipswich on a 93-day loan deal this week. Williams, who spent three months with the Tractor Boys at the end of last season, has not started a league game for Palace in the current campaign. 'There were four or five clubs after him - I just know Mick (McCarthy) will play him in the hole where I want him to play and he enjoyed it at Ipswich last season as well,' Warnock said. 'He knows I'm watching him and he's playing in the position I think he's better in. 'He's in my plans and he's going to be a very important player for Palace long term.'",

        "article": "The three French police officers killed in last week's terrorist attacks have been awarded the country's highest decoration today at an emotional ceremony led by the Muslim mother of slain policeman Ahmed Merabet. Mr Merabet was killed during the terrorist's killing spree last week when he was gunned down in the middle of the street by Said and Cherif Kouachi as he attempted to defend the staff of Charlie Hebdo. In a moving tribute, President Hollande told hundreds of people that Mr Merabet, Franck Brinsolaro and Clarissa Jean-Philippe 'died so that we could live free'. The coffins of the three slain officers - who were posthumously awarded the country's highest honour - were carried at a solemn funeral ceremony attended by the president. Scroll down for video . Hundreds stand at attention at the funeral of the three slain police officers, where they saw their former colleagues awarded the Legion d'honneur - the country's highest honour .

Here he is pictured as he is acknowledged by French President Francois Hollande (left) French President Francois Hollande embraces the mother of Clarissa Jean-Philippe, who was shot dead the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack . Mr Merabet, a 40-year-old Muslim, was executed by the killers as he lay injured on a Paris sidewalk as they fled Charlie Hebdo's offices. Mr Brinsolaro, 49, was providing security for the editor of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper, and Ms Jean-Philippe, 27, was shot dead the day after the massacre. The Marseillaise anthem rang out under grey skies as a grim-faced Hollande pinned the country's highest decoration, the Legion d'honneur, onto coffins draped in the red, white and blue flag, surrounded by weeping families and uniformed colleagues. Established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, the Order is the highest award in France. Chopin's funeral march was played as the coffins, draped in French flags, were carried from the building. 'Our great and beautiful France will never break, will never yield, never bend' in the face of the Islamist threat that is 'still there, inside and outside' the country, said Hollande.

Hundreds of police officers attended the funeral today - here they are pictured helping carry the coffins of the three slain officers into position . Flanked by hundreds of officers at police headquarters in central Paris, he told the crowd: 'They died so that we could live free.' He vowed that France will be 'merciless in the face of anti-Semitic, anti-Muslims acts, and unrelenting against those who defend and carry out terrorism, notably the jihadists who go to Iraq and Syria'. At the ceremony in the capital, Hollande went first to the family of Mr Merabet, the French Muslim policeman killed in the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo. The country has been shaken to its core by the bloodshed that began with a jihadist assault on the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine on Wednesday and ended in a bloody hostage drama at a Jewish supermarket two days later. The satirical newspaper lampooned religions and had been threatened repeatedly for its caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. Seventeen people were killed in the attacks, along with the gunmen. Meanwhile, the four Jewish kosher deli victims were today laid to rest at a funeral in Israel, where, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for Jews to emigrate to Israel for their own safety amid rising anti-Semitism. Thousands of mourners streamed towards the cemetery at Givat Ha Shaul, situated on a hill known as 'the Mount of Repose' in Jerusalem, as helicopters and surveillance balloons circled overhead. Coffins of the three police officers killed in the attacks are placed in the courtyard of the Paris Police headquarters during the funeral ceremony .

At the funeral, relatives of the victims each spoke briefly and lit a torch in memory of their loved ones before stepping off the stage with a huge Israeli flag in the background to embrace Israel's president, prime minister and his wife. Mr Netanyahu said world leaders were beginning to understand the threat of extremist Islam. 'I think that most (world leaders) understand - or are at least starting to understand - that this terror committed by extremist Islam represents a clear and present threat to peace in the world in which we live,' he told the ceremony.",

        "article": "Lying among a pile of papers at the hideout in Pakistan where Osama Bin Laden was shot dead was a carefully worded 21-page letter. It warned of the rise of a new and ruthless group of Islamic extremists capable of such extreme brutality that Al Qaeda should sever all links with them. In fact, it claimed the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (or ISIS) had such complete disregard for civilian life that it could damage the reputation of Al Qaeda – if such a thing were possible for an organisation that has long traded in murderous terrorism. Scroll down for video . The document, written by one of Bin Laden’s senior officials in 2011, went on to catalogue some of its acts of barbarism – including the use of chlorine gas as a chemical weapon, bombing mosques  and a massacre in a Catholic church  in Baghdad. In essence, the letter said that ISIS was simply too extreme even for the group that killed thousands in the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. Today, ISIS, which now styles itself as simply Islamic State (IS), has become a powerful military force that has control of an area larger than Great Britain. Living under its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam are six million people, a population larger than that of Ireland, Denmark or Finland. Its trademark black jihadi flag has  fluttered in the background of chilling ‘promotional’ videos of executions – including crucifixions and beheadings – as the militia seizes vast areas of Iraq and Syria. In short, the ‘caliphate’ – or Islamic state – it claims to have established represents the biggest shift in the political geography of the Middle East since  the borders of modern Iraq and Syria were drawn under the Sykes-Picot  agreement drafted between Britain and France in 1916. Discovery: A letter warning of the rise of ISIS was discovered at the hideout in Pakistan where Osama Bin Laden was shot dead . To understand the threat Islamic State poses to the region, it first needs to be appreciated how it has grown into a force to rival Al Qaeda. The group was founded by 43-year-old Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a firebrand cleric held prisoner for four years by American troops in Iraq. The leader, a Sunni Muslim who despises the Shia-run Iraqi government, now commands more than 10,000 fighters, many of them former Saddam Hussein-era soldiers or disenchanted Sunnis who lost power and influence after the fall of the dictator’s regime. More worryingly, foreign Islamic extremists, including about 500 Britons, have joined IS to fight in Syria and Iraq. The group controls valuable oil fields and, with the help of wealthy Sunni backers from the Gulf states, is estimated to have amassed a staggering £1.2billion. It has even sold 8,000-year-old antiquities it has seized. 'Too extreme': The letter found in the hideout used by Bin Laden (left) catalogued some of the acts of barbarism undertaken by the group founded by cleric Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (pictured right in a U.S. 'Wanted' poster) But its real assets lie in the fanatical loyalty of its fighters (they all swear allegiance to IS) and the state-of-the-art weaponry they now possess. Much of its armoury was seized during a lightning advance several weeks ago, when fleeing Iraqi  troops abandoned the artillery and armoured vehicles that they had been given by US forces. With captured American Humvees and the latest precision firepower,  it is more than a match for the  formidable Kurdish peshmerga – which defends the Kurds’ semi-autonomous region in the north – and its 12.7mm Soviet-era machine guns and outdated Russian  T-55 tanks. As Ali Khedery, a former American official who advised US generals in Iraq, has said: ‘They are literally outgunned by an IS that is fighting with hundreds of millions of dollars of US military equipment seized from the Iraqi Army, which  abandoned it.’ So it would be naive in the extreme to think of Islamic State as a motley crew of scrappers. A force capable of meting out so much wanton violence is invariably led by commanders who rule with an iron will. Chilling: IS's trademark black jihadi flag has  fluttered in the background of chilling 'promotional' videos as the militia seizes vast areas of Iraq and Syria . But what marks them out as being particularly savvy is the way they have used social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook to create a digital ‘public relations’ machine to promote their jihad and strike fear into the hearts of their enemies. Any fighter on the ground can film an act of brutality and upload the footage in a matter of minutes – although some videos of botched amputations or killings have led to a clampdown by IS commanders. One Spanish fighter promised  to upload a film of a man being  crucified for his friends back home, but was quickly reprimanded by  his superiors. His later contrite posting simply read, ‘Our leadership forbade anyone filming it.’ However, the videos already in  circulation have already created a climate of terror. Some opposition soldiers, particularly in Syria, are defecting to the group. After all, IS has money – some of which is said to have come through private donations from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Equally, those captured by the militia face a stark choice – defect or die. Despite being trained by American troops, the Iraqi army has proven worryingly ineffective in taking on this threat. It’s why the terrorists now control much of the north of the country. They have also seized a former chemical weapons plant and a large dam that could be blown up to flood the regions downstream. Escape: Thousands of Yezidis trapped in the Sinjar mountains as they tried to escape from Islamic State forces, are rescued by Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Peoples Protection Unit (YPG) in Mosul, Iraq . The populations of the Kurdish capital of Irbil, as well as the national capital Baghdad, are now in no doubt as to the fate that would befall them if these Sunni extremists prevail. If IS cannot be stopped, they are clinging to the hope that rescue will come in the form of Iran, which supports Iraq’s Shia-led government, or the US. However, both countries are reluctant to commit troops on the ground in the political and religious quagmire of Iraq. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi knows this only too well. It is why his IS troops have been so emboldened to sweep across much of Syria and northern Iraq in recent weeks. In the past fortnight they have fought on five fronts: against the Iraqi army, the Kurdish peshmerga, Bashar Al-Assad’s Syrian regime, the Syrian opposition and the Lebanese army. When he was released by the American military police from the Camp Bucca detention facility in Umm Qasr, where he was held as an insurgent, al Baghdadi said ominously: ‘I will see you guys in New York.’ A fanciful threat? Perhaps not, when you consider that the greatest threat Islamic State poses to the world is that this so-called caliphate becomes a training ground for international terrorism, and unleashes an army of extremists against the West to kill and maim far from the bloodsoaked deserts of Iraq.",

        "article": "It runs to more than 3,000 lines of verse and is the longest epic poem in Old English. Now, Beowulf - which documents the eponymous hero's battles with a monster and a dragon - will be made into a 13-part drama for ITV, the broadcaster has confirmed. The cast is yet to be revealed, but the series - described as a ‘Western set in the Dark Ages of Britain's mythic past’ - will be filmed ‘amongst the breathtaking beauty of England's North East’. Scroll down for trailer . Computer animation: A film called Beowulf, inspired by the poem, was released in 2007 starring the likes of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie . Links between the poem and Game of Thrones have previously been suggested, with character Jon Snow - played by actor Kit Harington in the HBO drama - compared to Beowulf himself. In the new drama, the broadcaster has promised ‘epic fights, thrilling chases, raids, celebrations and battles’ - and it will be filmed from April next year in County Durham and Northumberland. An ITV spokesman said: ‘Beowulf is a series about courage, greed, betrayal, revenge, loyalty, power, man versus wilderness and, of course, love. It is a series that explores the notion of good and evil, heroes and villains. ‘However, beyond these wider political undercurrents and inner personal turmoils are the excitement, danger and sense of adventure that any great Western has.’ Runs to more than 3,000 lines: Beowulf is one of the most famous works of Anglo-Saxon poetry, and its only known manuscript is held at the British Library in London, dating back about 1,000 years . The series is set in Shieldlands, a mythical area populated by both humans and fantasy creatures. The first episode will see Beowulf return to Herot to pay his respects to a man who raised him. But Herot is then attacked by the monster Grendel, leading Beowulf to hunt it down. The announcement comes after ITV unveiled a string of period dramas - such as The Frankenstein Chronicles, starring Sean Bean, and Jekyll & Hyde, set in 1930s London. Beowulf writer and executive producer James Dormer said: ‘Hundreds of years ago our ancestors listened to the story of Beowulf because it was a great adventure story. It scared them, thrilled them, made them laugh and cry. 'But they also listened because they recognised themselves and their fears in it. By holding a mirror up to them this story helped define them, and thus - us.

A film called Beowulf, inspired by the poem, was released in 2007 starring the likes of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie. Game of Thrones - starring Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey and Peter Dinklage among others - documents the dynastic struggles in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros for control of the Iron Throne. And California-based medieval literature expert Brantley Bryant noted in April: 'Some of the most sensational, violent aspects of Game of Thrones are actually also present in medieval literature.'",

        "article": "The lawyer representing one of four former Vanderbilt University football players charged in a June 2013 campus rape, says his client was 'too drunk to rape' or be held responsible for his actions. Vanderbilt tight end Brandon Vandenburg, safety Cory Batey, defensive Brandon Banks, and receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie were suspended and indicted in September 2013 for allegedly raping a 21-year-old female student and videotaping the assault. But now Vandenburg's defense attorney says her client was too drunk to know what he was doing and would not have been able to perform such a sex act, the Tennessean reports. Defense attorney for Brandon Vandenburg (pictured) charged with raping a woman in a campus dorm in June 2013 has said he was so drunk that he was incapable of rape . Date night: On June 23, Brandon Vandenburg took a 21-year-year woman out on a date to the Tin Roof bar, after which she passed out . Nashville prosecutors says the theory is far-fetched and wants to put a stop to the alibi before it goes any further. A new court filing asks a judge to block a Los Angeles-based psychologist from testifying about Vandenburg's drunkenness on the night police say he took part in the rape of his unconscious 21-year-old girlfriend in his dorm room. The psychologist's report suggests that the idea Vandenburg was so drunk as to be unaware of his surroundings but prosecutors say such an idea is 'purely speculative' and not based on science. Although the judge in the case has not ruled on whether to allow the 'evidence' during the forthcoming trial, it is unlikely that drunkenness would be allowed to serve as an excuse for committing a crime. 'Intoxication is generally not a defense to prosecution of a crime, particularly when the defendant was 'voluntarily' intoxicated,' said David Veile, a Franklin criminal defense attorney and continuing legal education instructor to the Tennessean. Veile said intoxication wouldn't help Vandenburg clear himself of recklessness, which is one of several factors in prosecuting aggravated rape. Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her but his defense lawyer said he was far too drunk to do it . Freed: Brandon Vandenburg was released from jail this in September 2013 k on $350,000 bond . '(Defendants) cannot later claim that they were 'so drunk' that they were unaware of a substantial risk,' he said. The psychologist's report also provides a new account of what happened when Vandenburg and the woman arrived at Gillette Hall after authorities said they were drinking at The Tin Roof bar. According to CCTV video, a 'very intoxicated' Vandenburg drove the woman's black Mercedes through an intersection without stopping and parked near a police vehicle. Vandenburg bumped the woman's head on the car door before seeking help from three other men to take her inside. He also hit his own head on an elevator and vomited in a bathroom, 'intoxicated to the extent that he could not have possessed the required culpable mental state to form intent to be held criminally responsible for the actions of the others that were in his room,' wrote psychologist Stefanie Stolinsky. The defense also wants to prevent the victim from testifying at trial. During the attack, Vandenburg sent a picture to another player, Chris Boyd, which he deleted, prosecutors have said. Boyd received an 11-month, 29-day suspended sentence after pleading guilty to criminal attempt to commit accessory after the fact. Prosecutors say he attempted to cover up the rape. Afterward, Boyd sent a text to Vandenburg saying he and the other players who had been there should delete the photos and videos they had taken. Boyd said he was looking out for their interests . According to an account given at a different hearing, Deputy Attorney General Tom Thurman said Vandenburg took an unconscious fellow student to his dormitory in the early morning of June 23, 2013. Earlier appearance: The alleged rape is believed to have taken place in Vandenburg's room, and the victim did not think he would have allowed anything bad to happen to her (Vandenburg seen here in October last year) Cory Batey (left), Brandon Banks (center) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (right) are the other players facing two counts each of aggravated sexual battery in connection to the June 2013 rape . He was joined by three other dismissed players — Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian \"Tip\" McKenzie. The student was sexually assaulted \"by different individuals,\" Thurman had said. All four are charged with several counts of rape and have pleaded not guilty. They are free on bond. Banks and McKenzie face separate trials. The case has become cantankerous with the defense and prosecution trading allegations of misconduct against one another. The trial begins for Vandenburg and Batey on November 3rd. Two other defendants, Brandon Banks and Jaborian Mckenzie, have their own separate their trials to come.",
